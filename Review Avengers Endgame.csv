1,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,1,An end to comic book movies would be merciful,"I think every comic book character is included in this mess of a movie. They do a lot of CGI fighting and emoting in front of a green screen. Some bad guys get vanquished. Good guys make some quips. Dateless 14 year old boys get a fun night out at the Googleplex. Girls stay home and study for mid-terms because they're our future engineers and doctors. Scarlett Johannsen looks terrible as a ginger, by the way."
2,Easygoer10,1,Per For Pre Pubescent Kids,"I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely. It's simple. They have integrity! Skip this woeful hyped up trash and go see a real film; not a cartoon."
3,allanmichael30,1,Thanos now a bum,Captain America switched with lokki at some point in past and captain never returned. This was more like a soap than action movie.
4,MovieCriticOnline,1,"My God, it was bad...","Josh Brolin's voice was totally wrong for Thanos. The lips didn't even match the words. I'm also just tired of seeing the SAME old mad man trying to destroy the world and getting defeated by super heroes. Too many characters. At least with the Dark Knight and some of the X-Men films they mixed it up and felt fresh. More superheroes doesn't mean better. Plus the acting was atrocious. The wooden repartee didn't help, done only to make sure everyone gets their lines in. Try a new storyline and/or approach. SKIP IT!"
5,ferdmalenfant,1,Just terrible!,They've really scrapped the bottom with this one! Oh so Bad!
6,Eli_Elvis,1,Pathetic.,Infinity war was amazing... this... nope. Hollyweird just doesn't know how to finish a story anymore. Paint by numbers and submit to a committee. Was it bad? No. Was it good? No. Robert Downey Junior is the only good thing in this film.
7,XhoXhuXhamen,1,Hopefully The END!,"When is this Long-Winded, Boring Comic series going to end? My wife loves this bunk, so I've been subjected to every one of them. Sure, I liked the first Iron Man. But manufacturing characters and writing a senseless plot just for the sake of another CGI spectacle is too much. I hope Thanos actually exists and puts and End to Marvel Comics Inc."
8,umlaziking,1,Terrible,"The writers went to far with this one.Somethings wrong with today's society,for ppl to even consider this garbage as one of the greatest films ever made with an of 8.5 is a disgrace.8.5?????seriously,this film is an abomination to marvel fans and the entire human race,there was no love and passion done with this it was only for money.I hate this film and I especially hate the writers who did this,this couldve been the greatest of the greats."
9,tristanostara,1,The highest grossing most disappointing marvel film of all time,"This movie was the biggest let down and anti climax of all time, I am one of the true marvel fans having grown up with the comics and watching all the big and small screen adaptations however this movie had the hype and potential to be the biggest greatest movie of all time , it wasn't it was rubbish !! And a joke , I felt so strongly about this i created this account just to write a review on this horrible movie . I won't spoil it but it was a rip off and a cheat infinity war was amazing 10/10 but endgame is 1/10 also just to rub salt into the wound there is no end credit cut scene so don't waste your time.... you are welcome, I can't believe the money this movie will make and it isn't even any good"
10,ProjectAnomaly,4,Endgame,"Beginning was great, ending was great, I barely stayed awake in the middle."
11,evilnigga,4,Cheap fan service,"Everything that marvel has worked on for the past decade comes down to this epic climax. Surprisingly enough they pulled it off. It's not like every other Marvel movie where they all feel like a commercial for a movie that has yet to be made, this time it really feels like an ending but also a new beginning in a different direction. Despite it's grand spectacle they're never seem to quite grow from the formulaic storytelling, the only difference in this movie being there is more subplots. It is quite boring even for a superhero movie, running at an astonishing 3 hours, they spent the first half setting up for the giant climax that is basically a mindless action scene inserted with some emotional scenes that holds no value to me. On one hand this movie does its job as an homage and a fan service, on the other hand it is still the same old superhero movie that lacks risk and anything that challenge the viewers."
12,diggnuts,4,It is another movie for kids.,"For what it is, it is fine. Enough pew pew pew, smashy smashy and flashy effects and explosions to mindlessly entertain the inner 8 year old. THAT is all that this is. Anybody who thinks this type of media deserves the highest marks is a cultural empty vessel. Anybody who thinks this colourful nonsense should be rated like actual movies with actual content is deluded. Mindless escapism is fine. it just isn't art."
13,opashabms-90700,4,I might be the only one who doesn't like the way things ended.,"I am a Marvel fan, and probably the only one who didn't like this movie. Felt like it was slow, non sensical and unlike the previous Avengers movie, I didn't care what happened in the end. Dissapointing for me."
14,chi_town_fed,4,"A horribly, boring and goofy installment. Worst one yet.","This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense, comedy, and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's masculine-man-hating society. Based on today's man-hating culture, testosterone is evil. Women should be lumberjacks and Seal Team Six. Men should take estrogen pills and ask their wives to open the stuck peanut butter lid. I'm a proud sexist. I open doors for ladies. I also send my lady flowers just because, versus craftsman tools. This was one of the worst Avengers installments ever. Writers are so busy pushing their masculine-man-hating agenda by making the two most powerful Avengers (Thor and Hulk) water downed buffoons. They failed to capture the essence of the Avengers. If the Hulk and Thor are not smashing something or someone that is extremely powerful, Marvel isn't worth watching IMHO. They are the ultimate warriors. Yet in this installment, they are childish buffoons while the film piles on the feminist propaganda scenes. The nadless, testosterone-hating writers of today have devolved the Avengers franchise into a dramady sitcom."
15,varun-25071997,4,Repetitive and Bland,"Blockbuster movies are made to entertain people and we mustn't expect logic, I fully agree with that. I had great fun watching MI: Fallout and Alita Battle Angel this year but Endgame turns out to be like every other superhero movie that came out this decade. The opening scene features Jeremy Renner losing his family after Thanos' actions in the last film, after that scene to till the end the movie just bombards us with video game like action sequences and unfunny jokes. The plot of the movie is much better most superhero films to its credit but the dialogue and screenplay was no different. While I don't want to spoil the plot, this film has bought back all characters associated with the MCU and is a reunion delight for many hardcore fans. The final battle sequence is my least favorite part of the film, it features random action sequences and right from the very start you would know how its gonna end. If you are expecting it to be like the ones you saw in The Lord of The Rings or Harry potter you are gonna end up disappointed. If this is Robert Downey Jr.'s last film as Iron Man as per reports its a great news for all movie buffs, a talented actor like him has wasted his last 5 years acting only in MCU franchise movies which didn't fully utilize his potential. Finally, this movie is going to be the biggest blockbuster of the year without any doubt but its only the beginning of end of the superhero genre."
16,Derache,4,Made for nerds.,"Personally as person who isn't too much into all this comic book stuff, I watched this and it wasn't even mediocre. This was a terrible movie. The drama, characters and action all where really bad. There were still some good scenes in the movie, however over the 3 hour long movie, most of it was terrible. A lot of the acting felt forced, especially with the female superhero actors. There was not a good presentation or an interesting and surprising ending. Not to mention the terrible comedy spread throughout the film. Constantly repeating jokes that were not funny, and lots of references that were rather unfunny and forced. This felt like a nerdy fan film sequel to the really good movie, infinity war."
17,desertscrpion,4,The Wait is Finally Over. To The Last Chapter Of The Avengers Film Franchise is Here.,"After The Davastaed Events Of Last Year's Avengers infinity War Saw All Of Marvel's Awesome And Cool Superheroes Which includes Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Maria Hill, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Drax The Destroyer, Mantis, Groot, Scarlet Witch,Vision, Black Panther, The Wasp, The Winter Soldier And The Falcon All Turn To Dust And Ashes By a Snap From The Mad Titan Himself Thanos After He Collected All Six infinity Stones in His Gauntlet....

The Verdict is, Robert Downey Jr. in His Last Role As Tony Stark/Iron Man Who Gives One Of His Finest Performance Of a Lifetime, Along With Chris Evans Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth Jeremy Renner Paul Rudd Don Cheadle Karen Gillan And Scarlett Johansson All Deliver First Rate Performances As Well As Black Widow, Captain America, War Machine, Hulk, Thor, Ant Man Nebula And Hawkeye Also Too it Was Great And Cool To See All Of The Other Cast Members Comeback As There Believeable And Iconic Characters in Which includes Bendict Cumberbatch As Doctor Strange, Sebastian Stan As The Winter Soldier, Chadwick Boseman As Black Panther, Elizabeth Olsen As Scarlet Witch, Anthony Mackie As The Falcon, Evangelion Lilly As The Wasp, Dave Bautista As Drax, Chris Pratt As Star Lord, Letitia Wright As Shuri, Danai Gurira As Okoye, Pom Klemetieff As Mantis, Vin Disell As Voice Groot, Zoe Saldana As Gamora, Tom Holland As Spider-Man, Gwyneth Paltrow As Pepper Potts, Brie Larson As Captain Marvel, Benedict Wong As Wong And Tessa Thompson As Valkyrie As They Come And Help Out To Fight And Destroy The Villainess Thanos For One And For All Played By Of Course Josh Brolin. Another Thing Of What i Like About This Final Chapter Of An Avengers Film Are Flashback Scene Sequences Of Seeing All Of The Pervious Cast Who Started in These Marvel Movies Are Robert Redford As The Villian Alexander Pierce And Frank Grillo As Brock Rumlow Both From""Captain America"": The Winter Soldier"", Nalalie Portman As Jane Foster And Rene Russo As Frigga Thor's Mother From The First ""Thor"" Film And it's Sequel, Tom Huddleston As Loki From The First Avengers Movie"", Tilda Swinton As ""The Ancient One From ""Doctor Strange"" John Slattery As Howard Stark Tony Stark's Father From ""Iron Man 2"", And Hayley Atwell As Steve Roger's Girlfriend Margaret Carter. Anyways Avengers Endgame is Truly One Of The Best And Perhaps The Greatest Final Avengers Film Of All Time With Action-Packed Moment Scenes, it's a Little Bit Of Emotional At Times Epespecially Since The Scene That involves Black Widow Who Scarifices Herself To Retrieve The Soul Stone And Avengers Endgame Has Great Humor Moments As Well. P.S. This Final Avengers Film Goes Out To The Great Late Stan Lee And For All Of His Cameo Appreances in Every Marvel Superhero Movie That He Started in."
18,urthpainter,4,One of the Worst 8.5+ Reviewed movies on IMDB,"First of all - this movie had to be brilliant to back up all the hype and legacy from earlier films. So is it brilliant? No, it's not even close. Second of all - Endgame just isn't a very good movie in any noteworthy sense, outside of effects and really good action scenes. And this brings me back to my first point. Perhaps this formula would work during the rise of comic films, but I can't see this film as anything but a huge disappointment. After a brutally emotional opening scene, that I have to admit - is really good, Endgame then proceeds to jump from scene to scene with inconsistent tone, pace, and development. A serious movie can have great humor, but the way Endgame uses slapstick humor, and non-serious characters is, well - silly. Is this a serious movie or not? Many of the films rules or conventions are openly broken to serve secondary storylines, and much of the 'science' is just plain dumb. I can suspend disbelief and get into stylized movies, but so much of this movie just comes off shallow and not really well thought out. This includes the story arc that to me has little natural flow. Many comic movies today seem to come off more as bad, incomplete TV episodes that rely on being part of a series for relevance. Movies should never be like that, and Endgame felt to me like three TV episodes jammed together, with three to five tac-on false endings. While I really liked many of the action scenes, which are clearly well conceived and beautiful to watch - at this point action scenes should be a given, and the story should have the same excellence. I don't feel like I'm being to picky when great movies in the Marvel universe exist (Dr. Strange for instance). I don't consider Infinity War one of them, but it's a heck of a lot better than Endgame. To me, outside of the opening scene, all the emotional moments fall absolutely flat. Considering the conclusion of Infinity War - there is a blatantly obvious sequence that should exude the epitome of joy. This part of the movie is hard to explain without giving spoilers, but in my opinion - this sequence is the writers biggest failure of the movie. The reunions are not well executed. Objectively, this movie probably deserves a 6 for production values, great action, and resolving the Infinity War outcome. But subjectively? I really thought this movie kinda sucked."
19,randomStuff101,4,"slighty awkward or boring at times, slow dialog, some cool stuff","Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time. Clumsy Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much. The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight. Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really. Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of story."
20,shahrad,4,Much ado about nothing,"I'm an Avengers fan but to me, Endgame was the worst part. Infinity war was much better. Even the action scenes are incomparable. Only 4 stars!"
21,michaelheiser-25099,4,Not a great film sorry,"Not a great film, sorry. At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is. I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him."
22,bogeyman786,4,A crock of ....,I'll be in the minority in that I didn't enjoy it. I'm not a huge marvel fan but having to watch 20 odd movies beforehand and keep track of the on-going storyline is a bit much
23,feritciva,4,"Endgame, begin disappointment","Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I expected more elegant & complex solutions. But what this movie gave to me was huge disappointment - with a little fun here & there (mostly includes Thor). In the end, Infinity War remained as far more better movie."
24,films-22537,4,Fan service the movie!,"On first viewing you love how everything is tied up. Stop there! If you've only seen this movie once do yourself a favor and don't ever watch it again. On second viewing this is a below average overly long film in which very little happens in a bloated second act. The only thing that still stands up is the Avengers trinity of Thor, Captain America and Iron Man versus Thanos, but it real makes you question the power levels of these characters, Thanos took them all out with no stones. The time travel subplot has more holes than swiss cheese I don't care how much screen time they gave explaining it and ""joking"" about it, I quote joking because in the MCU references count as jokes. There's the soul stone, in the last movie you had to make a sacrifice, how is Black Widow's suicide a Hawkeye sacrifice? How does Thanos not feel all 5 stones leaving his glove? Why so much build up about the glove in the previous movies if Iron Man can make one in a few hours, there's more, there's so much more but, at the end of the day Disney's 3-hour infomercial manage to make billions of dollars while not anger China or SJWs in the porcess, so for that alone this was impressive."
25,ellagilbert-23101,4,truly awful,Appallingly bad. Full of plot holes and convoluted action scenes. Maximalism for the sake of maximalism is not entertaining.
26,blownwideopen,4,How is this possibly at 8.6?,Let's see ... we can't write a decent story or come up with anything original any more. So let's just throw every character ever conceived of into a giant mashup & that'll make a great movie! Right? WRONG!!
27,allnewsuperfake,4,It's the kind of happy ending where your are happy that it's over,"Expect everything from this movie, because that*s what it's trying to be. It wants to be fan service. It wants to be an epic finale. It wants to be a beginning and stepping stone for the remaining heroes. It ends up being a collection of references and borderline fan fiction with a short 15 minute break for the kind of movie that you should expect from this franchise. Unfortunately you will be just exausted at that point by what retroactively seems like a bunch of ""Last week on Avengers"" clips. It's not even terrible, even though it's obvious filler material, it's often funny or heartwarming, but you see the minutes and hours walk by and it just. doesn't. go. anywhere. Up until the aforementioned 15 minutes, and those are painful since they remind you of the movie that you could have and should have seen up until this point. Followed by yet another 30 minutes of an ongoing funeral where the brand is literally and figuratively burries itself. Avengers managed to overstay their welcome, but I will still remember them fondly. But I also won't really miss them after this."
28,scubaseven,4,It's a movie.,Saw it in 3d otherwise it would have been terrible. Too many superheros for my liking.
29,funbaggs,4,Garbage!!!,Garbage that fits with today's over blown pc generation of over thinking and numbing lifeless endings. Not a fan of these films and this was the worst considering the waste of talent and plot that just seemed to be about over the top nonsense. The sad thing is how many people fall into the trap of thinking this movie has any validity of reality!!
30,simevo-20093,4,Wow. Unexpectedly disappointing,Really good first half. Dreadful second half. Really boring. About 50% as good as infinity war. Very disappointing
31,archer191273,4,Oh dear. I can't believe how diisapointed I am. So dissapointed. I wanted to cry.,"I'd tell the story I saw but it was all so confusing. I can't believe how high the garbage has been rated!!! I have seen every marvel movie that has been release and watched and liked Infinity war though I thought it dragged on. No super hero movie should ever go for more than 2 hours...EVER. Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thought i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong. The action is good in this movie and there are parts I loved about it but the parts i hate out weighed them. Damn you Disney!!!!"
32,marialiiva,4,Infinity war was SO much better,"This one was boring. They could have taken out an hour of random stuff that was just drama material and boring. Also the best characters only came in the end (Groot, chris pratt and the other dudes from guardians of the galaxy) which is the only interesting part of the movie"
33,loyolite,4,Looks like bots are giving this a 10/10,"First of all it's a very loooooooong movie. 3 hrs. I was waiting for this one for months now, so excited at what was going to come. But Alas.. What a mess. The first hour is a complete boring time of them showing what the world has come to. I mean quite boring with slight humor. Second hour, the movie starts picking up, with more content (confusing time travel) and some good humor. The last hour (like when you are actually asking where's the action, where are the effects, 3D etc), it's starts to show some hope. And some action starts. Gets you going.. For a bit.. And then it ends. The action is hardly there.. Whatever is there is forgettable. Nothing worth like the earlier ones. Overall the movie is not a little below average, with nothing memorable in it. I can't believe the business is done. I came home and had to watch Infinity War to get over this one. And believe me folks... Infinity War was way better than this. Way way better with its story and action. Don't waste your money on this melodrama.. Watch it on TV when it comes..."
34,wvriend,4,As bad as sequels can be,"Hope 'endgame' means no more sequels. Story is so thin, the dialogues so silly and the melodrama painful that even the fine actors are not given a chance to show their abilities. What a marvellous waste ot time."
35,paul_haakonsen,6,"Visually great, but not an overly thrilling or exciting movie...","Well, I finally got around to watching ""Avengers: Endgame"", even though I already watched ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"", so I already knew some of the events that were to transpire in ""Avengers: Endgame"". And I am not really fond of the superhero genre, but I still watch the movies when given the chance, as they are usually visually fantastic and provide adequate entertainment. And of course with all the hype that ""Avengers: Endgame"" had gotten, of course I just had to sit down and watch it. First of all, the movie was long. A little bit too long actually. I did feel that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were taking their sweet time getting to the core of the storyline, and just dancing around the bushes. In my opinion, the movie did suffer from this. Visually, well let's just go with 'wow'. Yeah, the movie was phenomenally stunning to look at visually given the CGI and special effects. But of course, being a Marvel movie, then you'd have top of the line special effects. And it is the visuals that carry the superhero movies quite a long way down the road. Story-wise, then I felt that the plot and storyline portrayed in ""Avengers: Endgame"" was a little bit too predictable and too generic. You already knew the movie's outcome when you sat down to watch it. Of course, Marvel weren't going to kill off a heap of their most beloved characters. No chance of that happening. So there weren't really much of any surprises along the way. And the time traveling aspect of the movie? Seriously? That was just downright idiotic. What worked for the movie, aside from the great visuals, was the impressive ensemble of actors and actresses that made an appearance in bigger or smaller parts throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up for that. However, I found some of the dialogue to be a bit too corny and felt that it was written for a young audience. Was ""Avengers: Endgame"" a fulfilling closure to the Marvel storyline? Hardly so. The movie, while being entertaining enough, felt a bit shallow, with parts of the story quite poorly written. But if you, like me, come to the superhero movies mostly for the special effects, then ""Avengers: Endgame"" will definitely blow you away. All in all, I am rating ""Avengers: Endgame"" a six out of ten stars."
36,view_and_review,6,Solemn and Subdued,"I would be lying if I said that I wasn't a little disappointed. The Avengers: Endgame has been one of the most anticipated movies since... well since The Force Awakens but that was way back in 2015 and in this day and age that's like a million years ago. The point being: Endgame was the talk of the town since all of those beloved MCU characters faded away. Infinity War was such an epic movie what could Marvel do as an encore? Or better still, what could Marvel do to conclude the magnificent journey they took us on? If anything, Endgame proves that it's hard to write a perfect ending. Perfect endings are stuff of legend. Whether the ending has a twist, a ride off into the sunset, or a mixed bag they are hard to write and hard to execute. Endgame is supposed to be just as the title suggests: the end. This is where the Avengers wrap it all up. Endgame was one long goodbye and it seems they tried to make it as heartfelt and dramatic as possible. Infinity War started with a bang and ended with a bang. It was a fast moving roller coaster throughout. It came together so nicely with all the different characters, the different tasks, and the different battles. It was a superb blend of flavors that came together for an excellent meal. Endgame, on the other hand, was almost like a decompression. If you were huffing and puffing from Infinity War then Endgame was a chance for you to rest, catch your breath, and absorb all of what happened. It was a long slow exhale with just one last burst of energy before retiring. And it wasn't what I was expecting. Not that getting what one expects is necessary to be considered good because sometimes you can be surprised in the best way. After all, we've trusted Marvel thus far so no reason not to trust them to put the finishing touches on their masterpiece. Now that I've seen their final brush strokes and the completed work I have to say that their hand slipped a little when adding the finishing touches. Like a fireworks show or a symphony I wanted the ending to be this huge crescendo. I'm not talking simply about the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but the entire movie. I wanted to see all of the fine Marvel characters in their finest form, or close to it, as they went for their last hurrah. I wanted them all to be like John Elway retiring after his second Super Bowl, retiring on top, not Muhammad Ali who held on too long and had a less than flattering exit from boxing. But that's not what I got. We got to see heroics, of course it's a superhero film, but it was so subdued. The entire tone of the movie was muted. It was a somber morose three hours. The humor wasn't as humorous. The fighting was somehow less awesome. Everything was just darker and more lifeless. Even the hero moments which were supposed to evoke the most joy, awe, and righteous triumph didn't quite do it. Now it could be because it was 12 a.m. by the time the movie wrapped up and I was tired but I don't think that was it. Many a movie has revived me due to it's captivation. End Game didn't revive me or stir me in the way I thought it should. If anything, they put me to rest along with the Avengers saga. I was going for a conclusion, yes, but I also wanted reinvigoration and revival. Sadly, I got solemn and subdue"
37,Wuchakk,6,How can they possibly save half of all living beings in the Universe?,"How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in ""Infinity War"" weren't just a dream): magic or time travel. All I'll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of ""Back to the Future II"" (1989).""Endgame"" (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff's edge, and much more. Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can't concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie's overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute."
38,trashgang,6,way too long,"Maybe it's better to see Infinity War (2018) because it do picks up what is left of that particular flick. Clocking in over 3 hours it was for me way too long to watch.Maybe no-one will understand me but 3 hours it has to be good. And it do has it moments building up to the fight towards the last part of this flick but it also has a lot of boring moments and moments were they are talking too much.I's towards the last half hour that it really becomes what you're waiting for, the endgame. As said, it's not all that bad but the irritating conversations of Tony Stark made me yawn a lot and even reach for the remote control.Nice to see that Spiderman is involved sadly we do know by now that it could be a once in your lifetime experience. DC and Marvel coming together, not for Disney anymore. Money makes the world goes around."
39,imseeg,6,Silly special effects in an even sillier story. BUT the actors starring in it are good and the dialogues between them are terrific,"The good: how strange it is, that this movie is one of the biggest action blockbusters in history, but the acting performances in it are still really good! Tilda Swinton and Robert Redford, to name a few supporting actors, are starring in it! That's ludicrous. Those actors never star in these kind of movies. But they do, now. Therefore the biggest gift of this Avenger movie are the ACTOR'S. It's an actor's movie! The bad: it lasts WAY TOO LONG. 3 hours! What were they thinking? I got bored halfway through this story. The story is completely silly, although the dialogues are still very good. There is more bad: lots of SILLY special effects. I mean, come on, with SO much money available they could at least have come up with more credible looking special effects and sets, but they didnt. Conclusion: nice, mindless fun, with great actors. Too bad the story is so silly and lasts way too long..."
40,jamesrupert2014,6,Spectacular but redundant and uninteresting,"More of the same - following Thanos' elimination of half the life in the Universe, the remaining Avengers decide to go back in time (or to an alternative time path, this is not really clear) to yet again look for the Infinity Stones so they can try to reverse the malignant halving. Since the stones are scattered around the Universe, once again a number of sub-adventures ensue, then there is yet another huge battle in which everyone in the MCU gets at least a cameo (including Captain Marvel and Scarlet Witch, so everyone else could have just gone fishing). Since the plot includes time-travel/alternate realities and infinitely powerful wish-fulfilment anything can happen, so just watch, don't think. Smart Hulk and Fat Thor are a lot less interesting than their predecessors and one can't help but wonder why the least powerful (and least interesting) Avengers are sent into space rather than participate in the more mundane search in the past (or whatever) or could the filmmakers have found an actress who looked less like a Valkyrie from Teutonic myth than Tessa Thompson. While clearly a fan pleaser, I found the film overly-long, derivative, and generally uninteresting. Too bad, as I really liked 2018's 'Infinity War'."
41,jellopuke,6,"A fine ending, but a Meh movie","Yay! This ends the marvel movie franchise! What? It's doesn't. Ugh. Oh well, at least this wraps up a lot, ends the major villain plot, has a few laughs, and gives everyone a moment to shine. Sure it has a million logic and continuity flaws, but who cares when you're breezing through so fast. Doesn't feel like three hours and well worth watching. That said, I never want to see another marvel movie let alone re-watch one."
42,shakercoola,6,A victory lap for a loyal audience,"An American action adventure; A story about an ingenious inventor and scientist adrift in space with no food or water but his fellow superheroes, known as Avengers, must figure out a way to bring back their vanquished allies, and rescue the inventor, for an epic showdown with Thanos, an evil demigod who decimated Earth and the universe. This comic-book derived fantasy is the twenty-second film in the series of Marvel films and is a special effects-driven story and a direct follow up to ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and deals with themes such as loss, revenge, and the attempt to put right past wrongs. For viewers familiar with the previous films and characters, it provides exciting, entertaining action, witty humour and smart dialogue. But it lacks the exhilaration of ""Avengers Assemble"" and lacks the high point humour of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". By its second act it begins to feel predictable; it seeks gravitas but too many jokes destroy tension and suspense and there is a reliance on a time travel plot device which make a meal of the past, present, and future time continuum as narrative time. Thanos is the most interesting character, providing subtlety as the archvillain, and Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man is the fulcrum, as always, which is a boon because Thor gets bogged down in a belaboured comic routine and Hulk fails to deliver any of his trademark power."
43,RNMorton,6,At a loss for words,"It's the next day after I've seen Endgame and I still don't quite know what to make of it. So I'll mention the downsides first: 1) Infinity War was a mess, there was just too much thrown at you without making much sense; to expect the audience to recall all the ins and outs of Infinity War was asking a little much; 2) they do some real interesting things here, particularly time travel, but don't overthink (or even partially think) the real complications or it will ruin it for you; 3) some of the stuff that happens either doesn't make sense or runs counter to earlier Avenger movies, and 4) the raccoon from Guardians shouldn't have had a major role. Plus a bonus complaint, how they treated Thor was stupid. On the plus side: 1) the sheer weight of the movie is spectacular, with a few exceptions the CGI doesn't get in the way of the story; 2) the logistics of the plot allows some of our favorite characters to do something magical, deserving and sometimes quite unexpected; 3) the work by nearly all of the main actors is quite good. So to recap the Avengers book: 1 was the best superhero movie ever; 2 was a disappointing bust; 3 had too much to work with but some of it was good stuff; and 4 was enjoyable with some moderate reservations."
44,agmoldham,6,Extremely Ambitious,"I've never been a super fan of Superhero movies. Having said that have seen most of the marvel films. The one takeaway from Avengers Endgame is that it is an extremely ambitious piece of film making. It's unusual that so many of the actors and artists who many people have come to idolize over the years should come together in a film. The film starts five years after Infinity Wars ended. Not going to include any spoilers, but there's a good part of the opening half of the film spent looking into the devastating consequences of Infinity Wars which are very script/character driven. Not surprisingly the second half of the film is very much action based and the 3 hours running time fairly fizzes along. Although it isn't perfect Endgame is definitely one of the best Superhero movies I've watched and lived up to expectations."
45,TheTruthofItIs,6,An Endgame designed for pre-teens,"Never has so much been spent on glorious VFX to service an orgy of Deus Ex Machina in order to fulfill the standard juvenile Hollywood ending that the good guys always win. Such a pure, white bread, immature ending, I'm embarrassed for Marvel that so much effort went into an ending dumbed down for pre-teens. What's the point of all this comic-book-to-big-screen-madness if there's no doubt of the outcome?! I suppose they TRY to make it look difficult for the heroes but then you throw in never-done-before quantum-based time-travel and voila, good guys prevail. Such a colossal waste of story-telling, of sci-fi adventure. My soul weeps."
46,tchitouniaram,6,Dissapointing and too long...,"Dissapointing and too long...Basically,only the ;last hour was watchable... Previous entries were much better."
47,brunovanael,6,"Best, better, a mess, ok","Endgame was definitely better than infinity war. Luckily they did not make the mistake of staring all marvel heroes on every planet and in space (or at least not for the main part). This film was literally about cleaning up the huge mess infinity war left behind. Better, but far from the great first 2 parts of this series. A very slow pace, overly long, far fetched story full of plot holes. Some nice elements though like the ""back to the future"" part. And as expected there was the obligatory tear jerking part at the end."
48,pensacolacomputer,6,Not as epic as you would expect,It's an ok movie but do not go in believing all the hype and expecting a perfect movie... if so you will probably be disappointed...they should have cut it down about an hour and it would have been much better
49,girvsjoint,6,Endgame Thank God,"Think they've done the super hero thing to death and this one is no better or worse than any of the others, except it's a good 30 minutes too long. The CGI runs rampant as always, plot is ludicrous as they usually are with these things and if this truly is the final instalment it's come non too soon! A lot of young people love these kind of films of course and good luck to them, me, I'd prefer a good western!"
50,troy-daniel-bush,6,It's good.,"It did its job at providing a satisfying conclusion for the quadrilogy. I don't think that it does anything exceptional or bad. Actually, that's not true. It does one thing exceptionally: It's three hours but I never felt the runtime. And it does something bad: The fat suit for Thor looked soooo fake. And I personally thought what they did with the Hulk was hilarious. But I'm honestly sick of Marvel at this point. I'm sick of superheroes and supervillains and the whole interrupting the plot to make a joke thing. And I can only see myself watching this again if someone else wants to watch it. I'm glad The Boys is a thing!"
51,boris_unanimate,6,"Too much hype, too little substance","For a movie that was advertised as the ultimate ending to the 3rd phase of Marvel's superheroes, I was a bit disappointed. It took 1.5 hrs to actually get started, involved a lot of nonsensical crying and weak build-up to the real story. The action was quite engaging but when the wizards finally teleported everyone onto the battlefield, it was too confusing because you barely knew where anyone was in relation to everyone else. Too much SJW pandering, but what else do you expect from Disney and Marvel nowadays, quality content with serious issues being treated seriously? I like the movie for what it truly was - the ending to a great saga. But let's not kid ourselves - this is a kids movie with tons of product placement. It had some great action, but the best one was the practical stunts and fight choreography, not the CGI moments in front of green screens. Could have been a full hour shorter and with less fake tear-jerking moments that actually had no true value other than they were fully forced upon viewers. Also, many of the emotional moments were ruined by stupid jokes, and the great jokes were sparse. I am glad it's over."
52,Inda_Rebel,6,Ok,"The usual serious drama superhero film from Disney aimed at teenagers and above. Should be more universal. I'd prefer it to have a lighter more fun tone to it, like Guardians of the Galaxy achieved for an ensemble cast of heroes."
53,clarkmick33,6,Hmmmmmm that's a NO from me!,"There must be a lot of brainless fan boys highly rating this movie ... compared to its predecessor (Infinity War) Endgame was a real let down. I won't reveal spoilers. But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring. Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers. And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down."
54,acdc_mp3,6,"Had its good, its bad, not as much ugly as I expected.","Story was decent, albeit a bit predictable. CGI was cumbersome, but I expected it to be so I dealt with it. There were some really good poignant scenes made this movie watchable to me. The bad was there were your typical action movie cliches that after hearing the audience guffawing and cheering over them, I have come to to peace with the cliches will live on forever. What I found interesting was that there are some unanswered questions that make me think that this is not actually an endgame, but what do I know? They were pretty damn significant to just leave out. Bottom line it was a fun movie to see with the family and it was definitely something to see on the big screen."
55,martinsplads,6,Disappointing movie,"I thought that Endgame will blow me away, I was wrong. Infinity Ward was an amazing movie, it got 10 out off stars and it just a flawless masterpiece with no errors just pure art. Endgame is full off meaningless crap like the awful humor with cheesy one liners that just destroys the entire movie. It's not funny please stop it I thought while the movie just keep going with these lame and embarrassing jokes that just bored and got me mad at the movie to the point that I wanted it to end but it never did. Another bad thing is that Endgame is so predictable that its just a joke, you don't even have to watch the movie to know how it ends. But the movie did entertain me and it really got tearing up scenes that left me emotional and great character ark, acting and action scenes, but the problem is that there isn't enough of these elements to save the movie, and what's left is a big letdown. Good dammit."
56,BBogus,6,"RIP MCU, Endgame very appropriate title.","Super hyped and still entertained but felt underwhelmed and disappointed. Yet, the writings were on the wall with Cpt Marvel. Nonetheless go watch as this will be the last MCU with still a bit of quality. It is obvious which direction future Marvel films will take and it will not be good. Rest In Peace MCU."
57,yavoyavo,6,Decent ending let down by bloat and feminism,"The special effects are top notch, but the film is very bloated at 3 hours when its a simple tale of a cop out time travel ending. There exists a ""De-Feminized Fanedit"" that proves the point, at a little less than half the length it tells the same story in tighter and frankly more effective form. No random appearance of immersion breaking over powered mary sues and the rest, just a slog fight of actual avengers and superheros working together for a single goal because it's necessary, and not because some over powered character feels some kind of sick amusement at watching everyone else do most of the work. What could have been a perfect two part send off is marred by this modern faddish politics being inserted into all entertainment to its detriment, hopefully this will all soon pass and simply will be remembered as a strange marker of its times."
58,marcusdavis40,6,Did'nt like It,"Watched this movie last week .I have to say that i did'nt like this one as much as i liked Infinity wars.I found it to be predictable in parts plus it was way too mushy for me in certain bits.There was way too much hype for this ,i came out of the theatre pretty disappointed ."
59,dieseldemon85,6,"Scorsese: ""This ain't cinema"". He's right!","I didn't hate this the same as the Transformer franchise, or reboot of Star wars. Unfortunately they all are cookie cutter films, look, taste, feel the same, nothing really sets it apart. My 2 biggest issues with this film were did it really need to be 2 3/4 hrs long. I figure with a good film editor they could have clipped 25 min and not ruin the pacing, the second is Bree Larson. I just find her unlikable. Downey, Hemsworth great as always. Would love to see Hemsworth, take on the 007 role once Craig retires. Last cameo for Stan Lee.Endgame isn't a bad film, just nothing really special about it either. I can find more fulfilling ways to spend 2 3/4 hrs."
60,benowen-91207,6,Marvel (in general),"I want to get this out that I don't think marvel is overrated. Although I'm not a huge fan of the whole universe, I can understand why many are. I really like a great deal of the movies, my favourites is probably guardians 1 and 2 I'm very happy that this is a financial success, it's always fun to see marvel out do themselves at the box office, and this film is nearly the highest grossing movie of all time. Critically however I find this movie overrated, Unlike infinity war this film meanders a lot. Many of the jokes don't land and some of the scenes are down right stupid. I though the last action scene was great and the dialogue like usual is fun If you think this is the best movie ever I don't want to change your opinion, personally I cannot understand this being 0.5 ratings below the Godfather"
61,CitizenCairParavel,6,Very good ending BUT . . .,"The first 2 hours of the movie were pretty boring. Great last hour but, boy, was I ready to get to the final hour. Did love last scene with Cap America. Won't say anything more. CA:WS and first Avengers were my faves. This ranks probably #3 or #4 of the Marvel movies. Plus sweet cameo by Stan Lee. Would have been funnier if he had not died recently. Bitter sweet."
62,kelboy10,6,End with no game,"Pretty sure Robert Downey Jr got his lines wrong. What he clearly meant to say is back to the future is clearly a way better depiction of time travel. Long gone are the days where movies had real emotional empathy and believability, they must have got washed up in the shores of time. Great Scott, if only we could go back to when these film had tangible sets and characters with substance and weight. This movie begins where infinity war left off with half the population doing a disappearing act, involuntarily of course. Our main protagonist Iron Man is lost in space and somehow found out of nowhere with very little reason. The new kid on the block has a talent for picking out people from space with, with her arms, or so it would appear. Eat your heart out superman!! Yet we are willing to let most this go, the task of expanding the universe further seems exhausting enough. With a barrel load of character to tackle not even three hours can save this mess. Maybe because they have to stick to their Hollywood Marvel formula and get the routine thirty minute, am I watching a kid play Mortal Kombat? Battle scene in!! The only thing missing is the vintage finish him voice at the finale. Reminence of the battle scene in ""ready player one"" springs to mind. Don't misinterpret me I don't mind a well built up epic conclusion but unfortunate this felt like a reversal of what had already materialised in the previous outting. As far as character and acting goes our main bunch handled themselves to the usual standard. We had nice chemistry wisecracks and charisma throughout the film and with regards to pacing it's a little slow to start off with. It's a good thirty to forty five of we're getting the band back together!! Without giving too much away it is a very linear one dimension story but still packs a bit of a punch with some humour and emotion from time to time. With regards to empathy I felt more for the characters towards the end than in the early stages. I felt like they failed at the start where you should feel really sad for the friends they lost but they all seemed to have moved on five years on. Scarlett Johansson's character was the only one who made me feel like it had actually happened. Overall it was an average finish, nothing to go to mad about."
63,thetyvonlesure,6,3 Hours Too Long,"This film is no Masterpiece. The Russo Brothers phoned in for a relevant follow-up to Infinity War. The first two hours were incredibly dull and boring. This film was filled to the brim with Fan Service and not enough Original Story. The final hour was amazing and worth the price of admission. The movie could've been condensed and it could've gotten to the point sooner. The humor feels forced and lazy. The film was filled with jump cuts and reused camera shots from previous films. The CGI is well done. The acting is poor at points. Overall, this is an average film, with two-thirds of it falling under below average."
64,willcline-91043,6,Could've been better,Okay I'm waited a long time to watch the movie and I've got to say I'm pretty disappointed first they made two of the biggest stars into jokes thor is a fat sloppy drunk and hulk is a big green Sissy I don't even think Hulk threw a punch everyone wanted to see all the heroes come back and they did but they lost one of the greats at the end could have been so much better
65,jack_pearson,6,Great end to a saga,"This was eye candy and fan service at its finest but then again, that's what the general audience wants"
66,type-a1pha,6,Colourful entertainment with an expected storyline.,"A fairly entertaining hero movie that, even with its long running time, doesn't really feel tiring. It begins interestingly and in pure Avengers style it becomes more and more chaotic as time progresses. This is a consequence of the too many storylines that need to be merged and the too many characters that are to be followed. Tonal shifts are omnipresent and a few characters are thrown out of context for the sake of unnecessary comic relief. With the story progressing, typical cliches of ending stories become apparent and unexplained convenient turn of events start to happen. This is nothing new and, as in the previous movies, sometimes it's just impossible to make sense of how and why a situation occurs. You have to accept it for the sake of the storyline be it someone suddenly becoming overpowered, acquiring a new power or conveniently stumbling upon a revelation. In the end, an unimpressive and quite predictable storyline spiced with great effects, a good soundtrack and a few interesting characters."
67,jpolywog-52354,6,Not up to the hype!,Overlong and cheesy in the extreme. As a massive Avengers fan I was disappointed in the film. Who on earth decided to portray Thor as an overweight bloated drunkard?..That person should be hit with Thor's hammer. In a way I am glad that it has come to an end. It had become a money making machine at the expense of high octane adventure. Yes I will miss it but maybe not as much as I should!!!
68,siderite,8,A nice looking solution for an imperfect situation,"Imagine you have to write Endgame. You would have to find a way to reconcile several things: the expectations of the audience, the continuity not only with the other movies, but with future projects and past comic book ideas, the actors that just won't come back whatever the reason, America's unhealthy obsession with political correctness, the wishes of the producers, the wishes of the director, the wishes of the people paying for the movie. It is an nearly impossible task. As a solution to this conundrum, Avengers: Endgame was really decent. It has character build up, exposition - maybe too much of it, foreshadowing, great action scenes, great emotional scenes, great acting. It got rid of all the leaving actors in a very nice way for their characters. It solved the problem of the death of so many living creatures in a way that didn't mean everything was simply undone or redone or forgotten.

That being said, all the characters in this film are dumb. I mean, really dumb. They have lightning fast reactions, but their solutions are ridiculous. The whole concept of the solution, which I don't want to spoil, lends itself to improvement.; it was not spent in this story. Also, there is a key moment that ends (heh) it all... it could have been done minutes before. All the elements where already there. And there are so many logic holes in the plot that my mind just reels from thinking about it.

Bottom line: a very beautiful film for your heart. Doesn't do your brain any good."
69,blanche-2,8,action-packed and effects galore,"Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game."
70,cherold,8,entertaining and at times exhausting,"This story-arc wrap-up starts with half the Avengers and world in general dead and no way to fix it. Only of course they figure out a way, because that was telegraphed in the last movie, and some of that goes right and some horribly wrong leading to, yet again, a massive battle.

The movie is generally speaking as entertaining as the last one, although it's attempt to use it's time-travel conceit to include every single character from every cinematic marvel universe movie ever made can be wearying, with characters I don't quite remember, characters appearing too briefly to make an impact, and a tremendous number of non-speaking cameos that serve no purpose except to let the audience say, ""oh yeah, them.""

The first half is pretty zippy, with lots of banter and some flat-out slapstick. But the movie also wants to delve into the self-sacrifice theme, so the movie drifts into increasing levels of sorrow.

The movie ends, obviously, with a vast battle, and while it's quite good, with some serious ""wow"" moments, it is the smaller, character-driven moments that truly stand out, like two superheroes battling each other to be the one to self-sacrifice. And while the post-battle weep-fest seems a bit long, the film does end with a particularly satisfying resolution to one superhero's arc.

Endgame gives you the solid, expected Avengers experience. Comedic, dramatic, special-effects driven, and overlong. It's well worth seeing even though ultimately it's nothing you haven't seen before."
71,westsideschl,8,Poor Science but Who Cares,"The better the ratings on a sci-fi movie the worse the science, but who cares if we're being fed thus absorb ""fake"" information. More combustion powered & structurally dumb space vehicles making sounds in the vacuum of space & swooshing sounds in air. Well, looks cool as do all the super powers that seem to get crazier w/each new series release. Why are little things like glassy rocks so empowered in sci-fi/fantasy movies? Usual dumbed down dialogue except the three worded line by one famous (and the movie is loaded w/famous) actor (bet you can't guess who). Started slow, but got hot 'n' heavy towards the end."
72,tabuno,8,The Marvel Universe is Much Too Big for Two Movies,"More is not always better and a lot more is definitely mind-bogglingly hard to wrap one's senses around. After a slow build that effuses with emotional and relational devastation the movie thae turns towards a building resolution with multiple scenes of bravery and sometimes sacrifice. With so many super characters and subplots, its pretty difficult to really absorb the more intimate prolonged exposure that most dramatic movies offer. There are numerous attempts of pushing the audience's emotional buttons that abound in this superhero finale and in that effort there are a number of typical and well-execute ploys by scriptwriters to milk the scenes for all their worth. This grab bag of personas and dramatic and comedic turmoil all come together in a pretty full package that at times bulges at the seams. This is a movie that tries really hard to encompass the full panoply of the Marvel Universe which is likely too big for just one or perhaps two full length films to capture comprehensively or adequately. But nice, if impossible try."
73,briancham1994,8,Great Finale,"This film is a great finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it wraps up all of their prior threads. There are references to years and years of films but it all feels like it comes together very naturally. The use of time travel was pretty well handled and didn't get as messy as in other films. The story itself and the twists were very engaging. One of my main concerns is Captain Marvel, who is so powerful that the writers have to contrive excuses for her to be elsewhere. Otherwise she could just solve most of the problems at once."
74,jfgibson73,8,Endgame,"My biggest problem with this movie is that it focuses so much on Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America. I liked the way Infinity War juggled so many characters, giving them all great moments. The final battle is great, though."
75,alansabljakovic-39044,8,Emotional and very heartwarming film,This movie is very emotional and funny at the same time. We can see how much the characters have developed from the start of the MCU. I'm little dissapointed with the lack of fighting scenes and with the ending. I can say what scenes will make great memes. Thank you Marvel for this great period in my life and for all the great movies u created. Keep going on. P.s. Thanos in that garden reminded me of Shrek.
76,MR_Heraclius,8,Endgame,"There isn't too much in the way of suspense or surprises when it comes to the story, but there are some shocking moments and funny lines in this epic finale. Again, like many of the best Marvel films, the holes and flaws are covered up with humor and fan service, making everything okay. That being said, I did prefer Infinity War to this film, which really misses the leads of the other Marvel franchises that were ""snapped"" out. Overall, however, there are only a few ways you can wrap up the main story of the MCU, and this was a solid direction."
77,MadamWarden,8,Crammed fun that can't be avoided,"Honestly, I think there are too many Heroes for one movie so Thanos definitely helped us out. That said, the writers do exceptionally well to weave all the back stories, relationships, characters and emotional hee-haw together in one crazy 3 hour rollercoaster ride of CG action, emotion and gags.

Great fun but I yearn for the simpler single hero movies of yore, even though I still think the first Avengers movie was the Greatest!!!

That said, this will break every box office record as it is a MUST SEE!!!"
78,kevin c,8,Fitting finale,"Movie night with Iris.

The Avengers franchise comes to both a rich and mostly satisfying conclusion. This is complex and emotional stuff, but doesn't take itself too seriously.

Despite the running time the action felt paired back, and the intimate scenes given equal billing.

The basic plot is pretty clunky, but the Back to the Future gags acknowledge that. The feminist apologies even clunkier, and too late. However the film delivers spectacle, gags and an intelligent, emotional kick."
79,acedj,8,I honestly wanted to like this more,"There will be a lot of people gushing on here about this movie. Make no mistake, it was good, just not great. 21 films leading up to this point have built the tension, and what should have been a sonic boom was closer to a car backfiring. At three hours, this is a long movie. While there are moments of great humor and great sadness and great happiness, it also dragged in spots. One would expect it to be 95% action, but they spent a lot of time on fluff. Again, do not misunderstand me. I liked this movie quite a bit, but I wanted to love it, and sadly I didn't."
80,DLochner,8,An experiment that last forever,"Part four of this gigantic Avengers saga cannot really be evaluated alone. It is directly related to part three. You can put them together like two pieces of a puzzle. In my opinion, both together are much better than parts 1 and 2.

I'm excited. From the end of Part 3 at the latest, I was completely in the Avengers Universe. The action, the drama. Everything at a very high level, despite the many characters and superheroes. But the special thing about the Avengers is that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are not afraid to break taboos. In part four it is tough and it rarely gets cheesy or boring. Despite the very long three-hour runtime. In addition to all the superhero films, some of which dissolve into insignificance, Avengers looks like a little masterpiece."
81,zzhhhqing,8,"Thank You, Avengers","I am a post-90s generation, and I used to envy the ""previous generation"": audiences 40 years ago, the end of the Star Wars trilogy in their theaters; 20 years ago, audiences can see the ring in the theater The final chapter of the King series. The joys and sorrows of movie fans are not connected, but now we also have a common memory: Marvel Movie Universe. Thank you, Avengers."
82,Trevor-Kerensky,8,The final chapter (or is it?),"Without revealing too much, I enjoyed the movie. Yes, three hours sounds like a lot, but I managed to do it without pausing for a bathroom break. Now that I think about it, this is the last time I'll sit through a three-hour movie. But enough about that.

The movie grabs you and won't let go until the end. The three hours pass pretty quickly and even though Stan Lee is no longer with us, I'm sure he got a proper send-off. I just don't remember where. But I'm glad he was a part of the MCU movie saga. All of the Avengers do battle with a powerful enemy. Who will survive? Who will not? All that will be revealed when you watch the movie. If you've been following the MCU closely, this will be the major climax."
83,asb_deutsch,8,Everyone Will Love It,"I watched Endgame in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!

It may have taken 11 years, 21 films but Endgame finally has shown redemption and smart direction from Joe Russo and Anthony Russo

I want more!"
84,CountJonnie,8,"Perfect as a farewell, but slightly flawed as an action film","End Game is pretty hyped as one of the best movies. And it is a great movie. The directors succeeded in connecting bits and pieces from the past and the present. While making all actors shine and draw the viewer in a hurricane of emotions. But as a result, the movies pacing feels messy, slow, repetitive and fragmented.

That doesn't hurt the movie, because it's greatest strength is in the actors, mainly Tony Stark who has the superpower to carry this movie by himself. Further there is the fanservice to include almost every relevant star from the past many movies. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a high octane action movie with compelling fights. Those fights where there, but they were quick, messy, chaotic.

This movie's biggest sin is absolutely not that it is a bad movie. It's good, but not as good as Infinity War, and that's a shame. All flaws aside, End Game is an emotional roller coaster, that works as a worthy goodbye to not only some actors, but a complete sage."
85,dasa108,3,I wish Thanos had killed the producers of this movie,"It is a tiring movie. That is not a good sign. It took me two days to see it and not even the good stuff (with 45 minutes to go) saves the film from catastrophe. Let's start with the obvious: history doesn't hook. The decadence of some heroes (bad Thor and worse Hulk who looks like the green version of Beast from the XMEN), the tendency to be sentimental killing some characters, showing a powerful villain but with little intuition to handle situations where he has all the to win, to show a key character for his power who appears only at the end to show that even a superhero does not care about the shedding of innocent blood ... The directors were not more talented in handling a story that would have been more digestible if instead of an agonizingly long movie it had been made in two parts. There are two moments where the movie is saved: one is when Robert Downey Jr. Meets his father, the other is when Tom Holland shows a Spiderboy with sensitivity and stupidity. Nothing to rescue from the rest except the wink to the fans of Community (also of the Russo brothers) since they placed one of the leading actresses of that show. It is a movie that falls into the category of ""impossible to watch twice"". If Thanos were real, the first thing he should do is evaporate those in charge of Marvel and Disney for giving us this ordeal in the form of a pretentious and worthless film."
86,elliotte2,3,Adults with adult brains should take a pass,"This movie was bad for anyone who is not a paid Disney reviewer, a teenager or an adult who hasn't grown out of their teenage fanboy stage. There are too many scenes of unfunny one-liners right in the middle of people dying that it is a slough to sit through. The powers that people can do either changes or are forgotten between scenes. Even the action is so spread out with most of the movie being geeky time-travel talk. When the action does appear, it is edited so hard it makes it difficult to know (or care) what happens.

If you just looking for a popcorn non-thinking, background while I do dishes movie, maybe this works. Any adult with an adult brain that likes movies to make sense of have some semblance of logic....pass."
87,Maleplatypus,3,Just Too Much,"Mild spoilers ahead: This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy. SFX could be much better for such an epic attempt. Weepy ending with forced pathos ruins everything. I was truly glad when it finally was over. 3 stars for wrapping this up, hopefully for good."
88,skrstenansky,3,Bad,"This movie is just very overrated and bad. The visuals and effects were amazing, but the story was dumb and boring, half the characters were cringy and stupid, and it was just mostly talking for 2 hours 30 minutes, I had to speed up the movie 2x I was so bored and still understand what they were saying because they were talking so slow. This movie is like infinity war but the heroes make a ridiculous comeback and defeat thanos which is a way more boring and unoriginal ending. Worse than infinity war and not a good movie 3/10."
89,krzysiektom,3,"A moronic ending, fit for a moronic universe...","I give it 3 stars for the huge effort, special effects and good acting. Overall it is a stupid film, bloated with self-importance and sentimentality, with poor pacing. Action scenes did not quite land with me, you know, superheroes throwing and punching stuff, who cares."
90,tim-31315,3,What Hype...,"... and what let down! Slow to develop and fast and furious action in the end. The whole story line was awful and the ending pretty much may have been the ""endgame"" for me, in watching it any further. You may have to watch it to understand the future development - with new heros and old ones gone - but this has now become more of a ""transformer"" type kid series. So bye, bye for me."
91,Behnam-A,3,"An average movie, worth watching but not more","Story and the plot are the foundation of any movie and this film isn'tr very well in that matter. of course much superhero movies are like that however.

It is obvious that we can expect things that are not rational compare to real world in sci-fi or fantasy movies so we measure them in compare to their own introduced logic. we accept some basic unnatural things and then we follow the new rules. Based on the rules the marvel universe has introduced us previously, End Game has too many holes. characters suddenly get very stronger than what they were seconds before or in compare to their history with no reason. Time traveling bugs like in all other time traveling movies present here as well. this happens also to emotional relationships between them. movie has too many cliche scenes with boring dialogs.

when we compare this one to Infinity war, it is a huge disappointment. However, it is still worth watching and if you are a fan of Sci-fi, it entertains you. It is just an average superhero movie."
92,yaornw,3,Overhyped,"The first 30 minutes were almost all talk, so boring. They finally got to some action and humor but with too many characters to keep track of and an over the top storyline in ridiculousness, it was still just not that engaging, not to mention way too damn long. The first Avengers movie rocked. Every one since has been a disappointment unfortunately. Marvel and Disney need to recognize less is more still applies as a storytelling principle of great value."
93,xmike-25541,3,DOWNGRADE after very good Infinity War,"Dont get me wrong, i know 99% of the reviews are from marvel/avengers fans but hey im not blame you all youre are blind and marketing from producers swept you down. Let me see - opening was perfect but suddenly half of the movie is boring, cheaply dark, second part of the movie is too chaotic. Movie trashes other truly legendary films about their non logical sory but here is seemingly everything logical ? LOL ... I could name like 6 very stupid/ilogical/boring things but hey, whats the point. Im just glad all the avengers nonsense ended. I liked Infinity War for its adult-ish story, dark/serious tone, nice and attractive story but here producers knew that EVERYTHING goes and NOTHING will be criticised from die hard fans.. Even if the movie was bad in 50% of the avengers fan, still everybody from you would love it.. Producers have the luck that this franchise is very very solid in terms of acceptance.. For neutral fan like me ? theres HUGE gap between Infinity War and Endgame."
94,nickyb-79131,3,Lol,"Watched to see why so much hype. Audiences hear the hype and lose their minds. So dull. Downey is as always, or at least used to be, enigmatic. The idiocy of the script made me realise the viewers that like this drivel like nothing more than cult like worship of actors names, fictional characters and nothing else. Last one was good but this one was lamer than the new Hulk. Absolutely nothing to gain from watching this Disney reprise to a soy latte drinking generation. GOTG 1 or 2 was at least funny but this was just plain dull scenes welded together like a very expensive TV series. Petty in every way except the budget."
95,sharpjohn,3,Make the pain stop.,"I always like to watch a movie on the off chance it may be enjoyable. In the case of movie series the chance you may get a bad one you need to watch the next to see if it makes up for the bad one. This series has just got worse as it went on and this is just as disappointing, It was that bad i feel asleep watching it.,"
96,Humphreywashere,3,Way way overated! Boring and ordinary. Its popularity is inexplicable,"I read the user reviews before I saw this movie. I thought perhaps the negative reviews were a bit unfair. But no! The cinema was filled to the max- I have never seen this before! Today's paper reported it is the highest grossing movie in history! Why? The audience were enraptured, laughing at seemingly unfunny moments, and cheering when good guy characters emerged. I think everyone drank the kool aid! Most of the movie is ordinary and just like other Avenger movies. Special effects were used to insert characters in cameo roles. Nothing new here folks! I have tried to analyze its popularity and have concluded that it is really simple to please the masses. People dont want complex scifi, a simple good- bad guy formula with a touch of routine comedy, good looking actors made more attractive with special effects touch ups, and some character familiarity will do the trick. Throw in a lot of multicultural references and political correctness and voila! Big bucks."
97,lancelong777,3,Just another superhero movie,"SO many reasons to love this movies but so many more to just completely hate it. I mean, how many times can you just do whatever you like in a movie and have to explain it in the movie that it is okay because of this reason. What a joke. Also, the movie felt like a mixture of ten percent of ten different movies mixed into one and was just not fun to try to follow. In fact, after the most boring first hour in moviedom history, the movie just started to do stuff that felt like it was filmed before the story was even written or a script in hand. And please dont get me started on the Hulk, I wont spoil anything but will say that it was not a pleasure watching him become the weakest Avenger. This movie should have been cut down to about two hours - it would have still blown chunks but at least it wouldnt have been a sleepy third hour. The movie makes me wish that movies offered satisfaction guarantees and returns. I wouldnt have returned any of the snacks but I would have asked for my ticket money back. It stank. And finally, the biggest let down was the acting - these people get paid loads of money and their acting is stilted and boring. Well, enough - I must be wrong as it is making so much money. Sorry, don't see it."
98,ishaalramroop,3,"So so boring,","After all the hype on social media about endgame I would assume I'd enjoy an action packed title but I swear I literally fell asleep halfway into it, (not even joking, I had to watch the other half when I woke up) infinity war was wayy better, more action less drama, hard emotion etc the works, but hey I'm not a fan of superhero movies."
99,Growfeather,3,Not for kids,I had higher expectation from this movie but it turned out to be superheroes drama/comedy mixed with little action. There was very little action in the movie compare to past Avengers. 3d effects were not up to mark either. I was fairly disappointed by this one. If drama is your genre then go for it but if you like action then skip it.
100,declanleader,3,Just rubbish,"Three hours wasted, was about as good as declawing my dog and at least I like the dog. The storyline was terrible, and for many blatantly obvious reasons made no senses, to make matters worse it seemed to have more holes in it, than my old gym socks. Yes I know all the good guys weren't going to make it, everyone knew that, I actually hoped a few wouldn't make it, and that's not what I care about, this movie was rubbish it labored three hours to get to the point of dead good guys/bad guys then victory and bang happy ever after for two minutes then over. This is going straight in the never watch again list, unless trapped on a plane in which case fingers crossed for a parachute, but will jump without one."
101,matthewleighton,3,Pretty bad!!,"Went into this very excited, came out very disappointed. The worst avengers film, possibly the worst marvel film. It was incredibly boring the only reason I'm giving it a 3/10 is the battle scene that was the only entertaining part of the film. I don't get all the hype around this film. The visual effects are amazing (just like all marvel films). It tries to be emotional, but it's very predictable and it failed to do that for me. 3/10 very overrated."
102,venitianfun,3,Tedious,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the Marvel franchise over the past 13 or so years. I liked some movies better than others of course but still can't think of one I didn't watch at least twice. Endgame disappointed me. It was long, and boring. The time travel aspect was not at all believable, funny thing to say I know considering this is a movie about superheros but that's my take. Finally, the epic battle at the end had been done before much better in Ultron. Time to put this baby to bed. It had a good run though."
103,deloudelouvain,5,Disappointing for an Avengers movie.,"What a contrast with Avengers: Infinity War. I really enjoyed that one but this one just felt short in every aspect. First of all it was way too long, they could have written this story in half of the time. Three hours is already long for an interesting movie, so you can imagine how painful it gets when it's not that interesting. If I have to be honest I fell asleep a couple of times towards the end, that's how captivating this story was. Maybe one day I will watch it again to see if I missed anything but I have my doubts that I will do that. Not all actors are great actors, but that we already knew from this cast. This kind of movies has to have it from the action scenes and special effects, which this movie just lacked. I think this time we can call it a day and move on to something else. Bye bye avengers!"
104,jacobjohntaylor1,5,Okay I guess,This is a good movie. But it could have been better. It has great acting. It also has a good story line. It is not a great story line mind you. The Avengers age of Ultron is mush better.
105,kz917-1,5,Not so super...,"Ugh. This three hour opus did not need to be three hours.

Sure, it had moments. I love you 3000 being a stellar one. America's ass being another.

But mostly ick. Still I watched it as I have been a fan of the rest. Glad I waited for it to come out on dvd."
106,skay_baltimore,5,Average at best,"There are three movie tropes that have been played out to death: 1. It was all a dream. 2. Child/parent or man/woman switching bodies. 3. Time travel. Endgame cops out via door #3. It also got way too cute with Hulk's character, and way too emotional with Ironman/Tony Stark's character. The film felt like the writers/producers were either on speed or had ADHD or both. Key characters simply appeared, with no development whatsoever, most notably Captain Marvel. The net result was more like those things they have at carnivals called ""Spin Art"", where you just squeeze paint onto a spinning card, rather than real art."
107,dk777,5,Avengers: Endgame,"A disappointing end to an era of movies that started very well only to get worse over time. There are a few that are worth looking at as pure entertainment, and some make no sense to watch. Some parts are good and interesting, but the film is unfortunately mostly disappointing, from the whining Thor who is absolutely unbearable in this film, to the Hulk who was turned into a crappy creature from some sitcom. There was really no need for that. Parts of the film are completely unnecessary and pointless and they degrade the overall impression of the film. The special effects are of course good, yet this is a high-budget film, but that's just not enough. Too bad, this could have been a lot more than a mediocre movie with dazzling special effects."
108,mrpicky,5,It's Okay,"Of course it couldnt be as good as Infinity War. And to be fair it could be terrible, wich it isnt. But it is still not great in any way. 1 good joke and just a bunch of revisiting past episodes, thats it. Thats End Game. They sure leaned on tear jerking hard, and it did get me a little with Nebula reaching out. but overall it just shows that going into time travel paradoxes can be funny or stupid. And here it is second one i am afraid. Not a waste of time, but far from Infinity war. They would get so ,much respect if they actually ended it with IW))"
109,marc5477,5,Time travel is when you run out of ideas or cant write worth a darn,"As the title says. You know you have reached a dead end when you introduce time travel to resolve things. It works fine in shows that focus on it like Quantum Leap or Sliders but its usually a sign that you cant write worth a darn if you bring it into something else. That and alternate universes etc. They have been done to death and back and are just a plot device to overcome bad writing.

So anyway, I still gave this a 5 because the CGI and fight scenes were fun. Unfortunately, that is about all there is to say about this movie. It was pretty hollow. The only source of comedy came with the introduction of smart hulk who was just funny conceptually more than anything else. Otherwise, I actually thought that this movie made all the other movies worse because... time travel...

Its a shallow movie. Not worthy of its rating in the least."
110,baehr_adam,5,Cash Grab!!,I'm a lifelong Marvel nerd. I live and breathe Marvel; with that said I'll start my review. The story picks up immediately after Infinity War with Thanos decimating 50% of all life as they try and rectify it. The cast was good though I honestly felt it lacking in conviction besides Tony Stark. The action was lackluster as heck. Endgame is 30 minutes longer then Infinity War and had maybe a fourth of the action runtime that its predecessor had prior. Disappointing battles minus one which lasted all of but a few minutes. The comedy was Endgames only saving salvation to be honest. It pains me to write this because Infinity War was the best superhero movie since sliced bread for a culmination movie. Average at best for me. They should have stopped after Infinity War though I know the comics wouldn't have it. I personally thought it was a cash grab. I'd say watch it once absolutely but don't believe the hype. Endgame makes Age of Ultron look good AF.
111,kpassa,5,Tedious and Boring,After watching Infinity War I was expecting another action-packed blockbuster. Instead it was mostly a snoozefest as they tried to get everything organized for the not-so-grand finale. When it finally did get to the finale it wasn't worth the wait. If you judge it by money made it was a huge success but as a movie it was a big letdown from Infinity War.
112,Tudorpsih,5,"A love letter to the MCU, but a weak movie","From a fans' perspective, this has a lot of rewatchability value, but the plot holes bring down the whole franchise retrospectively. The directors took some creative choices that, for the most part, paid out, but watching this movie after the others in this franchise is a let down. Some heroes act out of character and although I felt the tension in the first couple of acts, the third one really didn't do nothing for me. Infinity War was better constructed, but this had more heart."
113,fingazmc,5,From a non Marvel fan...,"I got forced to watch the midnight release of this with infinity wars on before it and I fell asleep.

So I finally gave it another go, now I know why I fell asleep. For a non marvel fan (I love guardians and deadpool, that's about it) it really isnt very good except for the SFX (obviously) and the end battle is amazing I have to admit. But that's about it, btw I really enjoyed infinity war, so I was open to it, but besides A funny Thor bits there really isnt much."
114,nikhil_mi2,5,It is a really bad movie,"All through this movie it just feels like they are setting up an homage to the past marvel movies and characters, this in itself is not a bad ploy but the way it is executed is lame. They do not even try to make it interesting. And the whole movies drags along this way like it is entering some kind of depression. The Quantum time travel idea is extremely badly executed. it seems the idea was just an excuse to visit past movies and characters. In addition the characters are lame, they just don't have any mojo about themselves. It just feels like they knew it was the end and everybody appears bored or not interested. The last fight is pathetic. Again no excitement at all. And the heroes that died felt like they had to die just for the sake of it. Pathetic movie, even by Marvel standards."
115,sugardaddy-31900,5,Garbage and very disappointing,"I'm so disappointed in this film as it was the End! I waited months, maybe even a year for this to come out. I didn't watch any trailers or listen to any critics because I wanted this experience to be epic. It was boring, dull, flat and uninspiring. The messed with a few characters and in my opinion, ruined them. The fight scenes weren't the best and it did smack of SJW at times. Captain Marvel played a very small role in this, which I'm glad about, and somehow still managed to look like the hero. I'm a huge fan of the MCU which is why I'm extra disappointed. I can't figure out why this has such a high rating...or can't i"
116,lilfresh1992,5,"First Review, 2nd Underwhelming marvel movie","After the disappointing ""age of ultron"", infinity war was a breath of fresh air. Endgame,however, feels like a rush job, playing on the cliche time travel trope. The writers for endgame were better off letting Thanos keep the stones and having the avengers deal with their losses for the first half of the movie. I would of love to see thanos get to utilize the different stones and their abilities, instead of having the movie turn into ""battle for the snap"". The cliche girl power moment towards the end of the film was also cringe, you already did that in infinity war so it doesn't have that same impact this time around. Also the confusion, if there are 3 different tesseract's for the sake of plot, does that mean there are three different thanos? does the snap only defeat that timelines thanos or does he still exist in other timelines? The movie had it's moments, but i didn't leave feeling excited about it like infinity war, and once again the black order is useless, but whatever i'll still show up for avengers 5."
117,jjeliazkoff,5,Underwhelming,"A lot in Endgame was great but there were more than a few sub-par moments. There were numerous plotholes, including in relation to the major plot in the middle of the movie, they ruined several of the characters, and the final resolution was lame. And yes, there are about a dozen undeserved ""woke"" moments..."
118,JAS0NTURNER,5,Review Bots to the Rescue!,I like movies. I like big Georgia blockbusters. But as a human with an opinion and an account I feel I must help other humans in the right direction. And that direction is: Watch this movie in fast forward until you see something interesting. This way you'll be able to enjoy it and not waste 3 full hours. As for the bots who gave this a 10...I hope your internet is forever slow.
119,heorgehaywood,5,Average,The hype for this movie is way way too much. The movie is about as average as it gets its generic and churned out and lacks any real quality. No spoilers but they write them self into a corner go back in time and save the world from monsters. Granted the CGI is done extremely well and the cast is incredible but the writing is generic and is overall disappointing but that's just me.
120,llamaslothinc,5,Bad Writing,"Just a lack of any worthwhile creativity is evident all over this film. The writing is trash, infused with stereotypical Marvel humor and even more annoying attempts at trying to drum up tears. The only thing that makes this film worth watching in any way is the acting in some key moments by some of the outrageously paid all-star cast, specifically the performances by Downey Jr and Johansson. I think both of them did particularly well, and I wish the latter was more prominent. Besides that though, there are about 14,000,605 outcomes where this movie is made, and all but one are laced with egregious plot holes and devices. We didn't get that one."
121,hamedavodi,5,Ending was awful!,"By far, the worst Avenger movie among four, particulary for retiring certain key characters. In such drama, it make sense that someone should be making an ultimate sacrifice, which in this case Iron Man was the best candidate. But Natasha not being able to come after the snap by Hulk and/or worse, Captain America going back to live with her old love after carrying her coffin was quite awful!"
122,aarontp-1,5,1 hour too long - infinity war so much better,"Such high hopes for this movie after infinity war but was such a let down. Only real action was the last hour of the movie and even then it wasn't anywhere as decent as the action in infinity war. I understand the need to bring the story to a close but it could have been done with better editing out unnecessary storyline within the 1st hour, so dragged! If it wasn't for the ending action scenes I would have given it a 5! Last 15 minutes is also slow and 15 minutes of credits (no post credit scene). So it's 2 hours 40 of the movie and approx 20 minutes credits. Compare a massive franchise like this with lots of the rings trilogy and this is not the mega finale as hoped as return of the king is a proper send off!"
123,aarontp-1,5,Major letdown. Far too long,"Get action sequences they are very good but too short and the same old stuff we've seen in the other movies. There is nothing epic about this movie. It is 1 hour too long, Ironman is just as annoying as always, they destroyed Thor's character and it was very boring in the first half. There is no comparison to Infinity war or the first captain America movie which had pace and great editing. Even die hard marvel fans have said end game is not what they wanted. I do appreciate this kind of movie brings customers out that don't normally venture to the cinema but this is pure marketing hype and people obviously do not watch a lot of movies to say it's amazing! Watch more decent movies folks!!"
124,m_radicevic,5,From hero to zero,"What happened? The first one was so great and this turned into another marvel schlock film

Pacing was off. Timetravel leaves huge plot holes. Editing mistakes. CGI weak on some parts. No new music score.

Its like someone did a parody of infinity war"
125,idressn-info,5,Why did they made it 3 hours,I was waiting for this movie for so long and when I got that I couldn't wait to watch it when I started playing the movie it showed 3 hours I was surprised and then the dialogues I thought that I might have gotten the wrong one the one with no editing. I was 3 hours movie with 20 minutes of of that avengers which I was expecting. so disappointed how they ruined it for me
126,a-hilton,5,Could have been much better,I confess I am not an Avengers fan having missed much of the franchise since Iron Man. However as preparation for my trip to the cinema to see Endgame I thought I would catch up on the story by watching Infinity War and Ragnarok. I actually enjoyed both of these a lot more than Endgame. It promised to be quite a spectacle and the scale of the action sequences didn't disappoint. Some of the personal stories of the characters were also introduced quite well into the film. However unlike the simpler story lines of the previous two films as mentioned I think they tried just too hard with Endgame. Too many pieces of the plot thrown into the story just made it overwhelming and took the shine off what would otherwise have been a good conclusion.
127,Krawia,5,Good job concluding over 20 films,"It is hard to end a story especially with as many characters as the MCU so I came in expecting a weaker movie than Infinity War. The story ends appropriately for the main characters and they do have some satisfying character moments. The major battle scene was too hard to follow since there were too many characters in an environment that is already visually busy.

Overall a good conclusion to the story.

Could it have been better? Yes, but the same can be said about most other movies."
128,busaman,5,Captain What! The Avengers Was Great.,"When you bring a character in late and force them and their off screen agenda down our throat it is going to leave a bad taste. Say what you will but this is about the character and its rushed story.

The powers that be assumed all of us that like Marvel Pictures would slurp up the captain snowflake drivel. It will never happen. All the other actors had had enough too as was obvious during all the junkets."
129,duggies70,5,Worthy of a matinee,"I really wanted it to be good, I really wanted it to be excellent. But it was just slightly above average. It was way too long. I couldn't wait till it was over. I really don't want to give anything away, but I think it's one of those movies if you're watching it on DVD at home, you would have paused it and a lot of times to do other things, like take a nap!"
130,azzakwan,5,thanos conquers many places but fails at earth,"Epic battle, just like any sentai tv series or kamen riders where they all come together to help. out of many, wakanda help them and not much help from america. this movie serves as captain america 4 & bucky did spoiled early on even before infinity war came out of what captain america going to do to falcon. the previous thanos is smarter and stronger than infinity war thanos, he killed many and conquers planets but earth is no match for him. all thanks to infinity gauntlet. this movie has been contaminated by too much rick and morty's elements! you people just can't make a decent time travel movie like back to the future!

now russos, go make me ""community"" movie."
131,chrisdouglas-95092,5,Homeage to the past movie,"They spent a lot of time in this film trying to tie up loose ends from both the past and present with some fitting scenes relating to previous movies. I loved the film but spent the first hour wondering where it is going, and how long is it going to take to get there. The big battle was both good and bad. It seemed a little messy because they were trying to give each character some on screen action time. The CGI and effects are as always amazing in the MCU films though. Lots of cheering in the cinema and clapping too which was unfortunate as many gags and punch lines got missed. I will see it again so that I can just sit and enjoy the final story but unfortunately I don't think it lived up to the hype."
132,dchalabi-15526,5,Endgame or end of MCU,"Most cringe worthy superhero movie I've seen. I was eye-rolling most of the time. Near the end I was just hoping for it to finally end. I mean, where to begin, is totally messy and nonsensical! All the time travel doesn't make sense at all. After all the hype I'm so mad at how bad it was."

Do you like that premise? To make awesome from awesome is something but un awesome into awesome something else to do. First the bad is it has too much melodrama with faces filling the screen in different emotive expressions to bring more ""important"" to everything. It's like the Looney Tunes episode of opera singing with Bugs, Elmer Fudd, wearing helmets with little wings, and a fat white horse, the type that of helmet that Thor wears too. Never into this episode because I like FUN. Or like the symbol of acting, the frowning face and the smiling face so I get there's an audience for this that I'm not for. The other thing is referencing other movies in here. Some of the references people might not even like, numerous time traveling flicks mentioned, Hot Tub Time Machine, Terminator, BTTFuture, Time Cop, Bill and Ted, even in Cap: Civil War I recall Empire Strikes Back which I thought the same thing but didn't think there would be way more in this movie by the makers, as some may not even like some of those movies. This isn't a tv show, but a movie, it sounds like something people you're around would say, not actual characters in the movie. Thirdly there's too much sentimental domestic stuff rearing itself with too much ""family"" shyt , little kid crap, YAWN. This was a problem in Captain Marvel in the mid part in some shack remeeting an over emoting lady friend and her tyke, I was expecting Cap Marvel to present some tampons to her to ease her, or even the Skrulls wearing sweaters to make it cuter. These are space warriors in the comics, for Pete sakes. This is off the top of my head. In Endgame what I'm talking about is perfectly shown in one scene out of nowhere this happens: this guy is sitting on a front porch (I get he's from Iron Man but others may not have seen that) and his tyke says she wants cheeseburgers. ""You can have all the cheeseburgers you want, cheeseburgers, all of them,"" paraphrased, while spacing out having a sedated appearance, and this just cuts to another different scene. What the?!?!?? Geezers sitting on front porches, thanks movie. This encapsulates why this domesticated crap is crap.

Now the good stuff is this is funny af (af acronym was actually on some billboard recently kid you not) moments from Thor, a delightful chap, who's taken the spotlight a lot recently after being in the shadow in the early MCU, the opening scenes from Guardians is reshown from a diff perspective of like Starlord doing the same walkman listening and miming motions while the current superheroes spying on him hilariously. The revisiting of other Marvel movie scenes kind of work like from Thor: Dark World, Avengers 1, Cap: Winter Soldier. Dark World domestic scene works because it's around palace intrigue and I like the vibrance of that movie being the first MCU movie I saw. And also the elevator scene from Winter Soldier is reduxed in a funny way, and the Battle of NY from Avengers 1 also. The other thing is a fight sequence between Thor, Cap, Iron Man against Thanos which is impressive wow. It's here that it also shines. I think these other MCU scenes with a different spin are kinda cool, although I would have liked just to introduce its own thing this movie. I mean you don't see in Avengers 1 them resisting scenes from their solo movies. I know that they want to get this Thanos storyline out of the way though naturally and the whole story is just like the comics pretty much verbatim. Personally I'm ambivalent about that storyline frankly. I actually appreciate the movies that takes an insignificant plot and make something out of it.

But you know the good thing is these movies present loads of interviews, panel conferences, and those global cast events that are so entertaining to watch so ti's a win win. Wondering what is the key to happiness for all of those in those interviews. In Fractured Fairytales they say ""the happiest people are busy people"" but that's not quite, it's those who value their masculine and feminine (guys former and women latter obv.) It seems the doorways just open for those type of people, and the busy people-an illusion. I've worked so much and study and the doorways , are they flying open. It's these in these interviews, Scarlett who knows how to be feminine, Brie has a slight masculine to her and you see why people are like what the?? Cap Marvel movie people are not taken with that, it takes place like 2 decades ago and now men have to sit in theater who were around then and have to watch this smarmy lady onscreen, what does this tell you. Gwyneth Paltrow is another masculine, why is she here, the song in stores ""turn your magic on/I feel alive again"", you like that? She was with that guy until he's like no I don't want to deal with this masculine person I just want to make more songs forget this. I don't know the correlation between busy and this m/f thing I just know if you are too much in one it's OK to balance it out with the other thing to keep fun. I j/o every other day. Anyway so the movie has Thor hammer it up, Hulk smashes, Hawkeye lays some serious deep stick arrow, Black Widow looks spiderific, Iron Man unleashes blasts, and Cap just goes in raw."

Endgame is the highest grossing film ever worldwide and the 5th highest worldwide when adjusted for inflation. But it was complete Garbage. It is not part of the 23 MOVIES anymore.

After a year of waiting since that Epic Piece that was Infinity War, this is the Endgame that Dr. Strange was on about? What A Disaster, It was a complete shambles. They had perfect vision when they made Infinity War but it is like they lost the Power when making this silly borefest.

Problems with this movie:
° Where was The Living Tribunal? The Being was ment to Bring the Characters Back and Judge Thanos. Not this Time Travel Garbage.
° What happened to Captain Marvel? A whole origin movie for her, for the build up to this and that's what they produce? Is this a Joke?
° How can you destroy the Infinity Stones when each of them contain an Element of Existence itself?
° How Can You Put the Soul Stone back?
° How can Gamora come back from the dead but Black Widow Can't?
° Why is Hulk a Big Joke? Isn't he the Strongest?
° This Thanos doesn't know any of the people he is fighting.
° The Time Travel fix everything nonsense, do they not get it? It is just too easy and boring.
° The movie is way too long and boring.
° Thor was a complete Joke
° No Epic Battle between Hulk and Thanos that EVERYONE was waiting for.
° No Proper battle between Captain Marvel and Thanos that was built up to happen.
° The Final battle was Lacklustre

The Highlights were:
° Great Quotes from Thanos
° Captains America vs Thanos was Great
° The 'I Am Inevitable' Snap from Thanos was Really Great

This Movie was terrible, what the hell were they thinking?

The Endgame should have started out by Thanos Seeking to Make another Infinity Gauntlet for the purpose of defence, then using the Reality and Time Stones to recover his army. Begin Fortifying his Defenses on a different Planet with his army defending him and getting ready for the Avengers final assault on him now that they have recruited Captain Marvel.

The Living Tribunal Should of Judged Thanos and Brought the Characters back in this Movie.
OH Boy, they blew it. What a missed Opportunity. 😒"""
136,dagallop,2,"boring, bored, boredom - what a mess of a movie","What a crying shame that a movie that had so many people awaiting its arrival delivered so little. And, it seemed to take forever to deliver that!
I believe that this is one of the most critical reviews I have ever given and believe me, I firmly believe that it is wholly because my expectations were set so high by the franchise that it was pretty much doomed unless it was mind blowingly good.
If the story had had one thread of; 'that was believable' or even an odd; 'that could work' it may have been able to recover but, it doesn't. It doesn't even have a; 'that was cool' at any point either!
It's actually so boring I had finally found a movie I could replenish concessions during and didn't feel like I had missed anything. The reality is that I probably missed some really critical parts but it didn't matter, the movie had lost me long since then.
The entire story was so convoluted that it was just plain terrible. The basic thread was non existent and I agree with many other reviewers that certain characters were pointless.
Synopsis: Infinity wars was mediocre, this isn't. Also, personally, it has done so much harm to the franchise, I for one won't be bothering to spend the 'sizeable' costs involved in cinema excursions for any Avenger related future offering again."

146,wick27,2,"A decade to build, just 181-minutes to destroy......","The Russo Brothers will be forever known as the directors that failed a franchise and insulted the very fans that embraced it.

148,BA_Harrison,7,Forget Captain Marvel... meet The Rat!,"After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.
If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.
Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...)."
149,CinemaSerf,7,Three films rolled into one: I'd just watch the middle one - that's superb.,"Ok, at the risk of getting shot - what is all the fuss about? If you haven't seen the ""Infinity War"" (2018) element of this saga (which I did quite enjoy) then you need not bother with the first hour of this seriously long film. This opening section offers us a somewhat maudlin introspective on how the surviving ""Avengers"" are coping after their first, bruising, encounter with ""Thanos"". Aside from some quite fun scenes with Chris Hemsworth who has let his ""Thor"" character go the way of an inflatable sumo wrestler, the rest of this somewhat tedious wallowing is really pretty dull! Thankfully for all concerned, ""Stark"" (Robert Downey Jnr.) comes to the rescue with a plan for a time machine that will enable them to re-assemble, go back in time and knowing what they know now, work to thwart ""Thanos"". For the next hour, just about everyone (though still no cute ""Pietro"") from the Marvellian pantheon sets off on an exciting and excellent adventure film with great visual effects and solid sub-plots before building to a fitting crescendo as all must rally and take on their mighty foe and his metallic minions in a battle royal. Then, the last forty five minutes descend back into the doldrums again as they deal with the consequences of this mighty battle - and again, I found myself looking at my watch. It was always going to be very hard to sustain the high degree of energy that had accumulated through his superior series of films, so why did the last one have to be so long and drawn out? At it's best the cast gel well, the stories are strong and characterful with humour and a decent soundtrack, but for much of this - well it just isn't at it's best."
150,Mr-Fusion,7,"The MCU's riveting, moving, uneven crescendo","Let me preface this by saying that I definitely belong in the ""casual Marvel fan"" category; so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.
I liked watching ""Endgame"". It was clearly the more emotional of the Infinity saga, the villain was better handled, and there were times when I was firmly butt-in-seat for whatever came next. Did it need to crash the 3-minute threshold? Good lord, no! I never glanced at my watch (which I guess says something) but it's not without its draggy segments. And as much as I wanted the team to get back at the bad guy and make things right, I was more interested in the time-travel, fan service and movie-hopping than I was in the big battle scene.
Don't get me wrong; I know this is a milestone. Ten years' worth of franchise-building capped in one movie; filling the imposing shoes of vanquishing Thanos; raking in a billion dollars. It was less escapism for me than it was witnessing history in the making. That much was palpable. And this a good movie, but it's hard to say if it lives up the unbelievable hype.
For me, it's questionable."
151,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,7,"Pays off in the end, but a lot to sit through to get to it","After Thanos successfully obliterated all the Avengers at the end of the last film, all seemed lost for the survival of the universe. However, it becomes apparent that by travelling through time and collecting all the 'Infinity Stones', they might be able to create a space in time where they will be able to step in from the past and reverse the present. With all the gang lost in limbo after their defeat, they must muster all their strength together once again to save the planet.
Despite rave reviews that made the previous Infinity War appear average, I took the sweetest of time getting round to see the even latest addition in the Marvel universe films. You can't manufacture yourself into a comic book nerd, which would appear to be the best course of action to take in the present climate, where superhero movies have become more of an industry than a franchise. The suffix here is Endgame, which is surely what IW was meant to be, especially given the rug pulling, unexpected ending. But, in Hollywood movies, the good guys have always got to win, even if it means bringing them back to life through some ridiculously convoluted, Back to the Future riffing tale.
I'm all for action movies with lots of character development and effective backstories, but the Russo brothers here lavish each of their flashy, colourful protagonists with the sort of intimate examination you might expect from Ang Lee, fleshing out their humanity at the expense of any exciting action, which the devotees will be expecting. It's a detrimentally overlong and drawn out affair, that builds up to a big crowd pleasing finale at the end which is worth sticking around for, but has nearly worn you out completely by the time its got there.
For these legions of comic book fans that seem to have emerged over the last few years, it's a dream come true. But, for me, it's simply the end that saves it, and it's existence is surprising given what was meant to have happened at the end of the last film."
152,SAMTHEBESTEST,7,GIVE THE LOUDEST SCREAM FOR YOUR SUPERHEROES !,"Marvel took a decade to set the ""End Game"" on high standard and that plan has worked big time. We can feel the buzz, the hype all around the globe. Finally the Final Chapter in Avengers saga is revealed and does it live upto the hype? Yes, it does. Avengers End Game has every freaking element of heavy Commercial entertainer along with moving climax for die hard Marvel lovers and a fulfill end to the journey.
End Game was awaited for the one final Slash on the deadliest villain who killed half the universe with just one snap. People were excited to see how remaining superheroes battles with Thanos and do they survive? The script is 180 minutes long which is perhaps the longest film in Marvel Cinematic Universe so as expected it takes time to settle the atmosphere. Unexpectedly, Russo tries some Intellectual kind of stuff to get it right but leaves so many goofs which remains unanswered. After getting it right, since 140 minutes are gone, finally you get to witness what you actually wanted to see in this film from the start. The visually stunning phenomena takes charge and you just can't stop screaming out loud for your favorite superheroes.
The climax fight is followed by bit of emotional portion where you have to say goodbye to your superheroes. Marvel ends it good, but is it good enough? Is there anything new to see? Answer is No. End Game is the same Marvel stuff we have been watching since a decade, except that one segment where all the Marvel Superheroes comes together for the first and last time. Russo tried thier ordinary version of Quantam Physics but doesn't explain the theory till the core, in addition they took so much time to set the plot. Overall, Avengers is a complete Winner package and will rule the box office but it is not that High level Cinematic Experience which can be remembered for years. If tou like all the previous films of Marvel Cinematic Universe then this is something more for you, so don't miss it."
153,Fella_shibby,7,A disappointment when compared to Infinity War but still a fun watch for fans.,"I saw this with my entire family in a theater. It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War. In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who. The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds. The entry of Captain America with the background sound to save Vision in Infinity War was again epic but in Endgame it is not at all exciting. Rocket's one liners were good though."
154,arfdawg-1,7,Two Endings and About a Half Hour Too Long,"I won't include any spoliers in this review.

The movie is good and worth the six bucks I paid to see it. To be honest, there were a ton of super heroes in it that I could not even identify. And I'm pretty sure a couple of actors who come up in the end credits weren't even this movie at all!

For the most part, the movie keeps your attention with pretty much non-stop action and a decent storyline that follows up on the half-end of Earth ending from the last installment. It's a BIG movie with huge special effects and I imagine the entire roster of Marvel characters.

For me, the Black Panter group appearance was rather unintentionally laughable. I think it's the wakest of all Marvel super heros. And that brings up another point -- when all the super heroes work together you realize how dumb some of their super powers are.

There were not as many off hand comic remarks as seen in previous Marvel movies and I think that was to the detrement of the film. The new Thor is pretty funny, however.

As you might expect, the finale is a really big one and all the big guns are brought out for the ending. And when it's all done, you have to sit through a rather unnecessessary 30 minute coda. It reminded me of the third Lord of the Rings installment that just kept ending as well.

So the net net is, the movie is good, not great and a half hour can easily have been cut without a problem."
155,drqshadow-reviews,7,"The Perfect Ending, If Not Nearly a Perfect Film","It's been a long, fruitful eleven years for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and never has that been more apparent than in this, the true culmination of that protracted journey. Engame is a die-hard crowd pleaser, going above and beyond to check every box on the wish list, sometimes even to its own detriment. We get resolutions and payoffs to dozens of dangling threads, not to mention years' worth of fan service, while flashing back to the preceding films in a way that doesn't feel exploitative or redundant. Character moments abound, always a hallmark of the Avengers franchise, but where in the past it was enough to merely watch the big personalities bounce around a room, this time we see a tremendous logical change in each of them.

The plot suffers from pacing issues, leaves behind a whole slew of gaping holes and tends to over-rely on twists and misdirection where the expected route would've been much cleaner. It can feel disappointingly blunt at times, then surprisingly subtle and nuanced in others. At some points, more than a few, you'll feel that the Marvel slate has never been more forced, never cheesier. In others, you'll be shocked to realize you're still watching a superhero movie. It's not as smooth as the MCU's best, nor as efficient, nor as visually ambitious, but when it gets where it's going the results are spectacular. I credit that more to the decade of careful planning and coordinated execution than I do to this film in particular, though points are certainly due for sticking the landing.

When I found myself walking away from the cinema, contemplative and maybe a little bit shell-shocked, I experienced a strange mix of calm, relief and fulfillment. I wasn't amped up like a Rocky movie. I hadn't been through something titillating or epic, an instant classic that I'll assuredly watch over and over again. I just knew that it was over, I was cool with that, and I was satisfied by the closure. This iteration of the team went out on a high note, but not its highest. The perfect ending, if not nearly a perfect film."
156,cjonesas,7,Above average...,"Without a doubt, that's a movie which visuals are stunning as always. That does not disappoint. My main concerns are with the story, some unbelievable situations and battles. The results are not always what you expect, which IMO lowers the rating.

Avengers: Endgame is yet another case in question. I knew it going in and was in no way surprised by a predictable end to a mostly predictable story.

Its not bad as such. In fact, if you can accept it for what it is, its quite watchable on a superficial level. I'll add I'm not a film snob I enjoy a simple action romp from time to time and this certainly comes recommended.

There's a lot of wall to wall action that's well paced and keeps kicking along. My only gripe is the overcooked ending, that's so syrupy and sentimental, you could spread it on toast.

7/10 from me."
158,davidmvining,7,A great first two hours and a meh final hour,"This is more built like a traditional movie with a recognizable three act structure than Avengers: Infinity War was. I quite like it overall, but that traditionalism requires an antagonist that isn't really needed, I don't think.

The three acts are pretty distinct. The first is almost purely character driven. Our massive roster of heroes has been culled to almost exclusively the original six (Cap, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye) with a few others (Rocket, Nebula, Ant-Man). Considering the film's length, this gives each character enough time to stand out. I think the decision to jump ahead five years was very smart. The characters have all changed in those five years, and we have to spend time with each of them getting to know them again. We're essentially being introduced to new characters, and the movie takes its time with it. My favorite of these, not based on the introduction but based on what comes later, is Thor.

Thor is consumed by his failure to aim just a bit higher when he threw his axe at Thanos. If he had hit Thanos in the head instead of the chest, Thanos would not have performed the snap, wiping out half of existence, so he sits in a small corner of Norway where the remnants of Asgard have established a new home. He plays video games, drinks copious amounts of beer, and yells at 12 year olds who make fun of the rock monster Korg online. He's a sad, fat, king who lords over the small domain he wishes to keep (his living room). We see the other characters in similarly different states. Tony has walked away from a life surrounded by technology and lives in a nice wooden cabin by a lake. Cap leads self-help meetings. Hulk has found equilibrium with Bruce Banner. Black Widow stays in her office, sending other people out to search for Hawkeye who's left home after his family disappeared, killing those he deems worthy of death.

It's a surprisingly somber and solid hour of character based storytelling, introducing us to the new rules of a new world with familiar characters who've all changed. The one who hasn't changed is Ant-Man. Scott Lang was trapped in a gobbledygook science state that he thought only lasted five hours but actually lasted five years. He hasn't changed, and it is through his eyes that we mainly see how things have changed. He's also the impetus for the movement that leads to the second act: The Time Heist.

I've seen the Time Heist described as fan service, and I can't entirely disagree but I do in part. There's so much more to this than just seeing things from the past that Marvel fans liked from slightly different angles. That's definitely part of it, and we get some standardly amusing quippy humor, especially from Ant-Man, Iron Man, and Cap (""America's ass"" indeed). However, there's a lot more going on especially around Thor. Thor goes back in time (using gobbledygook science that Tony Stark pulls out of nowhere because movie) to Asgard during the events of Thor: The Dark World. The task of retrieving the Beauty Stone becomes completely secondary to Thor's time spent with his mother in a wonderfully touching scene between mother and son where she helps him find his purpose again. It's the sort of emotionally driven scene that believably takes a character from one place and gets them into another. I mean, a tender visit with your dead mom might do just that.

Before going any further, you have to talk about this new (old) version of Thanos. Thanos gets his head chopped off in the first sustained sequence of the film, but with time jumping, the older version of the heavy gets introduced. I have to imagine that there's a very early draft of this film that doesn't include Thanos at all past the fifteenth page because Thanos has nothing to do with the central conflict of the story (jumping through time to collect the Infinity Stones). He's purely extra. He shows up after the task is done to fight the world's mightiest heroes and introduce a late, unrelated, obstacle.

And that's what the last hour is, an unrelated fight that breaks out in epic style and is just packed full of fan service. The last hour is little beyond that. Every hero comes back when Hulk reverses the snap, and we get an even more concentrated and bigger version of the fight as in the last film. Don't get me wrong, this stuff is fun to a certain degree and well assembled, but the story's effectively over by that point and yet it just keeps going. I loved the movie up to this point, and then I just kind of got deflated. ""Oh, this is what we're doing now, huh?""

So, yeah, I loved about two hours of this and tolerated the third. The first two hours aren't perfect (Tony thinking about time travel for five minutes and finding the perfect answer is just the kind of ludicrous that Marvel is permeated with and sort of just bugs me), but the strong stuff there is very strong. It's just kind of too bad that the movie ""needed"" an antagonist shoe-horned in its final act in order to make fans happy."
159,mhorg2018,7,Could have used some editing,"I've been reading comics for over 50 years, and honestly, I was never an Avengers fan of the comics. In film, well that's a totally different story. While this was a good movie, I really feel it was too long. It could have used some editing. It was paced quite differently from any other Marvel movie, leaving most of the action until the end and that's where it lost me. They killed off the wrong characters. Two of them were the most popular ones for me. There would have been more Pathos had they made different choices. I'm not going to spoil this for anyone and say who was killed off, that would be simply rude. But it makes me wonder, has Marvel, after 22 movies, run it's course? Will Disney's need for PC ruin Phase 4? Let's face it, Disney is all about money. Their cancelling of their agreement with Netflix was a terrible one. No more Punisher or Daredevil? (I couldn't really care about Iron Fist or Defenders and I think the way Luke Cage ended was terrible, but I'd have liked to see him again). So Phase Three is over. What's next for Marvel? I'm not looking forward to The Eternals but I am looking forward to Shang-Chi. So overall, I give this an 8. I knew a few characters were going to get killed, but there weren't really any big surprises in it. Did anyone really think Black Panther, after making a billion dollars was going to stay dead?"

Three hour payoff for the days-long superhero movie parade that came before (twenty-one releases total, but is anyone really grasping to, say, the second Thor movie for continuity?); it certainly opens better than ""Avengers: Infinity War"" by virtue of its start-off point--rather than dizzily jumping through several reckless storylines and dozens of characters right off the bat, it starts at an elegiac pace, re-establishing the few survivors and reflecting on the loss and ruin that has shattered so many of their lives. Then it's down to the effects-driven action business--fetch quests aplenty and a colossal final battle. Convoluted at times, unevenly paced throughout, and a bit heavy on the illogical fan service and curtain calls, it's still a movie destined to satisfy its target audience (as crowd-pleasing a crowd-pleaser as there has ever been). Assembly-line in nature, but crafted with more love and pathos than the average product, it may not be able to escape its status as ""blockbuster punctuation,"" but at least it provides a sense of closure that previous Marvel Cinematic Universe entries often lacked. The actors, from the major players to the cameos, all do solid work, far more grounded than one would expect from comic book cinema; for some, it will be their swan song, so it's nice to see them go out on top."
161,saptesh786,7,Nothing Outstanding !,"Just saw so called and talked this movie. It is just hype and to say truly it is a movie that marks below previous Marvel movies. Because after seeing this movie your mind will be empty and you will be not satisfied with whole drama feeling that something was missing, yes thrill of superheroes is totally missing here. Reasons are following as me, others may have their own different opinion than me, but me, watch the movie only for full of entertainment with not much expectation. High rated tickets should give you full value of your money and three hours of life. High ratings are false and all are copying to support only for this average movie. Reasons are many; 1. The starting of last chapter is very slow and dull, whereas it needs some powerful actions or at least interesting incidents to keep viewers connect early to the story. 2. Hawkeye lost his family, how? And why not he lost himself ?. ( Thanos spares him?) 3. Planning to time robbery with quantum theory is very slow and time consuming only. 4. It takes too long time to start the real drama cum fight. 5. Time robbery is so confused. It is not cleared that how lost heros came return in life. What is that method was been applied not shown anywhere. 6. If Thanos is vanished by Iron man then how he will regain again to finish some superheros as shown in Infinity War ? Is there any paradox theories? Not cleared by director. Various time lines are so confused

7. In this such a big saga of returning our lost heros into life, what is the role of Nick Fury as he only show his face at final scene. As me he must have a major role for planning the time plan. 8. There is only a single fight, first and last with not impressive only lengthy and boring. 9. Such super movie must have solid logic plot and here Infinity War was better. 10. Nothing new plot. I actually wait till end to happen something different. 11. Captain Marvel has no significant role here even her character was created with a single separate movie to enter in Endgame? 12. Thor is shown drunkard with tummy belly. It is not acceptable as our hero is our role model. I actually feel shame to see such nonsense thing.

A very few things are good like CGI work, father of Iron Man, Natasha's sacrifice etc for name. Hulk's anger on footing stairs is just hilarious comical sequence. I really enjoyed it.

Acting is okay and no one expect good acting in such comics movies.

As me the movie is watchable but not for much entertainer. It is only deserve 7 star. And lovers of Iron Man and Natasha, don't be disappointed they will meet you in future because it is comics universe."
162,AvionPrince16,7,Good but.....,I really prefered the avengers infinity war. This movie was good but sometimes its get very annoying. Some jokes are good. The only point that i like was the end and all the event can cause for the future. I really love what marvel did with the avengers and the whole story behind it. Its very interesting to follow along.
163,Holt344,7,The Infinity Saga has come to its end and we got a satisfying and great ending but far from a perfect movie,"The anticipated sequel to Avengers: Infinity War and we're truly in the Endgame now. Having a three hour movie made the directors make the best movie they could, it's an emotional road as the cast and crew had teased but it's handled well. It starts off slow paced but thanks to the cast and writing crew we get some of MCU's best drama, with the long running time we get to see multiple of character arcs, great ones at that and it's mostly because of the directors and writers as they know the characters inside and out.

The ensemble cast is not as large as in Infinity War but it is what I personally found great with it as we get to really delve into the characters, seeing and feeling their emotions. They all just have so much chemistry, the whole ensemble and it's because of the friendship and all years of working together, it's what ultimately makes the movie the great movie that it is, the characters and actors playing them. There is so many great moments in this movie, character moments and just Easter eggs and nods to past movies, there's something for everyone that will make you fanboy as it's in a way a love letter to the characters. Almost all characters have been developed so carefully and perfect it's just a blessing to see them in this movie, simply stunning work to everyone that's worked on making the characters and MCU work. Strongest acting was from Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson, their performances are some of the franchise's best. To finish off the review I'm going to rate the final battle, it's amazing in so many ways. Shot and edited with perfection.

But the film isn't perfect, far from it but I would lie if I didn't say it was a great conclusion to the Saga we have followed since Iron Man. Avengers: Endgame is probably one of the most anticipated movies of all time and the speculation and theories made it almost impossible to satisfy every person and it was also hard to top Infinity War that was superb. I don't want to spoil the plot but there were a couple of things I really disliked but you are in for one hell of a ride and will probably enjoy this superhero film"
164,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,7,Mixed feelings,"The first half felt sappy and chatty. I found myself fighting the Zzzz in this first half. But the second half felt like a time travel thriller (a la mission impossible team). The climax with the actual battle was good, like epic battles we have seen before from the Marvel Universe. I was disappointed that there wasn't an end scene. I have grown accustomed to expect an end scene leading up to a new Marvel movie so I felt jipped watching the ending credits and not seeing an end scene. I think it's like a 6 3/4 out of 10 and I rounded it up to 7/10"
165,nicholls905-280-546911,7,Incredible in scope but not flawless,"The hype surrounding this film after Infinity War was unavoidable. This is the finale to a very long lead up of films and that final action scene is money well spent. Endgame doesn't have that flawless conclusion but at least it's ambitious. It is exactly how a massive ensemble cast should be filmed and it never feels one sided, it's an Avengers film. My issue with the film is more about the repeating villain and large plot holes left from the time travel. It lacks answers and leaves the clean-up to Spiderman Far From Home. I miss the times when films had to be complete and explained. Infinity War was a better film and offered more."
166,SoumikBanerjee25,7,Dissatisfied,"I have been a Marvel Fan since my childhood. It all started with Iron-Man and then flourished by the other movies in MCU! I watched each and every film to date. For a MCU admirer like me ; this film was disappointing to say the least. When infinity war ended, I was literally teared up by the experience I got. It boosted the hype, the anticipation to a new level! I was counting on the finale film to be the best I have ever seen in the MCU so far. But that dream, that wish of mine got shattered! Why? There are so many reasons behind it! Slow pace till the time travel sequences kicked up, lack of cohesiveness between the characters, not duly written script, lesser emotional impact ; all of these made the film less enjoyable for me. The only thing that saved it from being doomed for me is the Last 1 hour, the climax battle scenes are beautifully made. To have all the superheroes in one place and give proper screen times to everyone is a daunting task. They handled it pretty well! The performances especially from RDJ was memorable and touching at the same moment. Overall a decent film for my liking and for my expectancy that I had after The last film. It Should have been way way better. All of the True Marvel fans deserved it."
167,strike-1995,7,One lime,Some beautiful character moments that cut through right to the character's core and a fantastic ode to the past ten years. Just would have liked some nuanced action.
168,stevelomas-69401,7,Oh it's that lot again.,A film more concerned with making money and it's stars than characters or plot. No surprises and nothing new just lots of flash and really poor dialogue.
169,RussHog,7,Thanos is great,Some smart creative choices were made in this movie. Thanos is great. Captures the spirit of superhero crossover genre.
170,garabedian123,7,No one on earth reads these reviews before seeing the movie,"Okay..so spoilers be darned..THis movie was kinda very slow. Still a great movie. But can we talk about the ""Captain Marvel"" SCAM. They tricked us into thinking that Marvel played a big part in this movie. When she only has about 12 seconds of air time...12 seconds...ok that is an exaggeration...it was probably 10 seconds."
171,cliftonofun,7,A fitting climax,"Well, it finally happened: I got emotional during a Marvel movie. Sorry, not sorry. This film truly was a fitting conclusion to a decade of MCU films. While it was a classic action sequel, it was also filled with surprises, homages, laughs, and emotional moments. Unfortunately, that's a LOT to accomplish in one movie (hence the 3 hour runtime). Fortunately, almost all of it worked. They wanted to bring 22 movies to an epic climax...mission accomplished. I'm not sure that I would put this one alongside the best stand alone MCU chapters (Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok, Iron Man, etc.), but it somehow pulled all those movies together in a pretty magical way. I complain a lot about the comic book-ification of film, but I can also recognize the accomplishment that is the MCU."
172,andrewroy-04316,7,"A completely fitting and satisfying conclusion to the grand Avengers saga, delivering on its emotional closure","The greatness of Endgame comes in the ways it both builds on and pays homage to the many films that have come before it. Truthfully, I find it extremely similar to Infinity War as a movie, but with the core of the film being acceptance of events and moving forwards, rather than the conflicting ideologies and resulting battles of Infinity War. Both are most impressive in their ability to allow an enormous ensemble cast to breathe and never feel rushed or overstuffed, focusing on a few character's arcs and getting the audience invested in them. Endgame also continued to have excellent visual and sound effects, with some stunning action scenes that brilliantly balanced and mixed the strong score with immersive sound effects. The humor was effective and I found the use of homages and self-awareness in referencing past Marvel events or movie tropes (primarily the unrealistic time travel portrayal in movies) to be stronger than the traditional one-liners you find in movies like Ragnarok or Guardians. The plot itself was coherent and reasonable, relying on a fun and plausible ""time heist"", but I found it a bit anticlimactic after the challenging planning that it was so easy as to be almost an afterthought that they secured all the infinity stones (a task that should be monumental). I had my usual qualms with the action scenes, as character's powers or effectivity of specific moves don't seem consistent throughout the fights, but they were fun to watch as characters tried new tactics and it was not just a rehashing of the action we saw in Infinity War. Iron Man and Captain America's character arcs are both satisfying and appropriate for who their characters are and what their goals were. I did find the way Hulk was scripted to be bizarre and frustrating, as he was a character who had struggled to balance the duality of his nature in helping others with uncontrollable rage, and here he felt like a goofy, meandering character lacking well-defined characteristics or audience investment. Thor also had a plausible general story in blaming himself and struggling, but I thought it was played out to an absurd and over the top degree that's not realistic given his character. Still, I have no overarching qualms and felt the movie was handled thoughtfully and emotionally, feeling like the true culmination and crowning achievement that the MCU has built up to. It's satisfying and well done, but I don't think it's a better overall movie than movies like Infinity War or even Black Panther or Winter Soldier just because it's the finale that was done in that satisfying way rather than a more specific or intermediary story. I'm excited to see it shatter some records at the box office and see if it has a chance at a Best Picture nomination - unlikely but definitely possible. A great ending to a great series of films."
173,dfle3,7,New endings. New beginnings. 65+%,"A satisfactory finale to ""Avengers: Infinity war"", which surprised me, as I scored the earlier film a 4/10 on this site.

Why the improvement? Well, even though I hadn't kept up with the other films in this franchise (i.e. the Marvel Cinematic Universe) before seeing ""Avengers: Endgame"" (which was no different to how I saw ""Avengers: Infinity war"", this time I didn't feel as though I was missing important information or events from those MCU films which I hadn't seen. So, even though I hadn't seen the current ""Captain Marvel"" film and she appears in this film, there just didn't seem to be anything that I was missing by not having seen that other film. That wasn't the case so much with the Ant-Man character, but I wasn't really bothered by not getting the payoff which I presume was intended from him.

Since this is the finale to a sequence of MCU films, I won't bother outlining the story so far...you should at least have seen the previous Avengers films in order to be contemplating watching the finale. So, I'll just note some things which struck me, watching this film...it may, therefore, be more interesting to people who have already seen this film.

General observations:

* Whilst the film was generally satisfying, I doubt that it would stand up well to repeated viewings, as it isn't particularly briskly paced or action-packed (not that these are necessarily bad things, especially given how boring Hollywood films can be when they go down that route).

* I wasn't a fan of the treatment of Thor in this film. Even though I've never read a Thor comic, or watched further than the first film of his own franchise, I have to say that the humour revolving around him didn't work for me. He comes across as a plummy sounding Englishman who watches way too much LA based teen comedies or something. Some of the humour was conceptual, though...in the way that Monty Python can be conceptual...your head recognises the joke but you just don't laugh. I didn't mind his pun near the end of the film though, concerning another MCU franchise. I am curious whether Chris Hemsworth went ""method"" for this role though, or whether CGI was used instead.

* Another big problem with the film is that it just lacks storytelling smarts, as far as the action sequences go, although that flaw is pretty much endemic to every action film ever made. The second Lord Of The Rings film, I think, conquered that common failing, in that the war scenes displayed military strategy and tactics in a dramatic and engrossing way...but perhaps that had more to do with the nature of the military technology utilised in that story? To paraphrase this point, I'm saying that you don't really get scenes where you feel that your favourite Avenger is kicking goals, so to speak (and as I don't feel particularly invested in any of the characters, this didn't bug me so much). You don't even feel as though they are in mortal danger. All you get is countless thousands of CGI fighters engaged in battle, as is Hollywood's wont. There was a missed opportunity to create drama in those set pieces. For instance, much drama could have been made of Ant-Man's abilities and how they could avert a catastrophic loss of lives amongst the forces of good. You really don't get much on that front though...you see a little bit of tactics but no drama there, whatsoever.

* Connoisseurs of time travel stories might enjoy the proceedings of this film, as there is much meta-discussion about the merits of the logic of other time travel stories known to popular culture. For all I know, the theory of time travel espoused in this film might be as absurd or incomprehensible as that of any of the films that the characters in ""Avengers: Endgame"" critique. The discussion is interesting nonetheless and I may try to find the script for this film in order to become more familiar with the ideas presented in it.

* CGI plays a big part in this film, as I've already mentioned with regard to the battle scenes. It also plays a part on a more intimate level. For instance, I recognised John Slattery as the actor playing one of the characters in the film. He seemed too young though for it it to be him. I'm not sure whether CGI was used for him (maybe they just used conventional special effects?)...or whether John has discovered a new facial cream with wonderfully restorative properties for his skin. Speaking of John...his character has possibly the most bizarre handshaking technique ever represented on film. It also seems to me that Robert Redford got an even bigger CGI treatment for this film than Slattery did.

* I doubt that anything at all hinges on a comment that one character made in this film, but it sounds like it should...""We deal with it by not dealing with it"". I'd be interested to know if the relevant MCU franchise (""The Black Panther"") will revisit this comment.

* The comment about Doctor Strange ""giving away"" one of the Infinity Stones intrigued me. If that was in the previous Avengers film, I've forgotten about it. Maybe I should remind myself of the circumstances of that event? In any case, I'm not sure that this film sheds light on why he might have done that. Or did I miss something?

* Since this instalment of the ""Avengers"" franchise serves as a bookend, I wonder whether I can be tempted back to the MCU sometime, given that the MCU is very hit-and-miss, and mostly misses, it seems to me. If I can't, then not a bad way to end this fling with Marvel.

* Curious about any lore concerning who may wield Thor's hammer."
174,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9,It goes for the heart.,"First off, I'll just say that you should put aside any fears that its three-hour run-time might be down to a lack of pace, for 'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' moves exactly as it needs to and it really does fly by. It's not too fast-paced, though, as it takes the time to make sure its events have an impact, which is greatly appreciated. The story, which is shrouded in secrecy and - on my part - shall remain so, is actually quite bold. It never feels like it's under any pressure to move in a specific direction, constantly evolving in natural and, even, somewhat surprising ways. It may take a few small leaps in logic, and generally require a bit more suspension of disbelief than is usual with this sort of stuff, but it never breaks its own rules. Every decision the filmmakers make is for the benefit of the narrative, even those which gloss over - and, thus, retrospectively highlight - some of its (admittedly fastidious) unanswered questions. None of these possible, and only very slight, 'plot holes' even matter, though, primarily because the affair is so much fun. It also takes a lot of risks, being as far away from 'cookie-cutter' as it can. While it may lean towards some elements that long-time fans of the overall franchise might have seen coming, it always presents things in fairly unique, unexpected ways and consistently puts importance on character above all else. This is, as usual, what really makes the feature work. Even when things are at their biggest (and, trust me, they get big), you're never far from a smaller, often more satisfying character-revealing moment. The major characters here are more well-rounded than in 'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)', despite the fact that there's almost as many. This includes, thankfully, Captain America himself, who was somewhat sidelined last time; in fact, he's perhaps the main player this time, alongside Iron Man. Some characterisations are also unanticipated and will almost certainly be polarising, but they're certainly appreciated - even if only for the risk. The antagonist is a little weaker this time as he's a bit more traditionally 'bad guy', but he's built on a more-than-solid foundation and is as imposing as ever. Marvel have made no qualms in calling this the end of an era - the so-called 'infinity saga', to be more specific - and it really does feel like a culmination of this (over) ten-year journey, especially in terms of the 'main' Avengers. It's certainly a film for the fans and it isn't squeamish about it. It's incredibly satisfying, to say the least. It's also incredibly moving in a number of key scenes. You'll experience pretty much every emotion a movie can give you. The whole thing is slightly strange, helped immensely by knowing very little before going in. It's almost difficult to describe, in a way, but its effect is actually quite profound. I suppose it takes a while to 'come to terms' with. I don't think I've fully formed my opinion on it just yet. Don't get me wrong, though. It's great. It's more than great. It's a new kind of cinematic event, the kind of story only possible with a twenty-one movie backlog of character histories and audience investment. The more I think about it, the more I like it. The visuals are stunning, the CG is seamless, the action is spectacular, the characters are superb, the scale is staggering, the scope is substantial, the stakes are serious and the story is simply splendid. It really is something. 9/10"
175,cricketbat,9,A well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the MCU,"Avengers: Endgame is a well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you to reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga."
176,Top_Dawg_Critic,9,Excellent sequel!,"The almost 3 hours flew by with great writing and effects, and the change of the characters lives made it that much more entertaining - especially Thor! Better than I expected, and a wee bit better than the last film imo. 9/10"
177,southdavid,9,"""I like this one""","I couldn't have hoped for it to be as satisfying as it is. After 11 years, the Infinity Saga closes with the ultimate showdown that the MCU could have provided. I'm honestly not sure how they can top it.

Following the snap that concludes ""Infinity War"" with 50% of all living life in the universe extinguished, the remaining Avengers struggle to cope with their collective loss. Reunited with a couple of missing friends, the heroes come up with a daring plan, to collect the Infinity Stones before Thanos and return to their time, undoing the snap with one of their own and returning those lost.

""Endgame"" is perhaps, the ultimate fan servicing sequel of all time. Shorn back to (almost) only the original Avengers, the film is then like a greatest hits tour, as the time travel element allows the characters to revisit past MCU highspots from another angle. The film also includes dozens of lines of dialogue from previous films, and dozens of visual or emotional call backs and pay offs. The amount of characters it services is masterful, with each getting at least one or two strong character and action moments over the run time. (Whilst I'm on the runtime, any concerns that three hours would be a problem are forgotten as the film flies by)

It's not totally without flaws. It's a little laggy in its opening sections, and I'm not sure that the world following the initial time jump in entirely believable, but these are minor criticisms against a film that, with 11 years build up and 22 films back story, is more complete and rewarding than you could possibly have hoped it would be."
178,marmar-69780,9,avengers endgame,"Even if i really loved infinity war and i consider it to be one of best comic book films ever made in scale and heart,but i must say that i loved endgame even more since it doubled all that things and made them even better,and it give us great conclusion to the era of mcu since 2008,endgame had brilliant actors that did a marvelous job and i think that werent any weak link,thanos maybe less focused then in infinity war but still he was able to bring staff that we love about him,this film also has some very sad moments with emotional punch but i think that they did a great job in closing characters arcs and stories,sure there is some staff about time traveling that is messy but in this kind of film i simply dont care"
179,Vartiainen,9,Movie unlike any other,"So, an era has ended. It began with Iron Man in 2008 and now the story of the Avengers has come to an end. There will be Marvel movies after this one. Spider-Man: Far from Home is coming out this very summer. But in a very real sense this is an end to that initial line-up. I even wonder if we're going to have Avengers 5.

The story picks up a few weeks after The Snap. Thanos has won and half of all living creatures in the universe have been dusted. Bleak times for everybody. But, after some hard times and setbacks, a new plan emerges. A bold plan. A crazy plan. A plan unlike any other.

The film works. It pays homage to the previous 21 films and the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. It finds a way to give respect to all the great things that have led us to this point, while still working as a standalone film. Not that you should see this film on its own. This is very much the culmination of a saga. It's not required to have seen all of MCU before seeing this one, but it sure does help. A lot.

Furthermore, it's much more fulfilling to watch this movie as a diehard Marvel fan. It's a very fanservicy film, full of reverences, callbacks and little cameos. It is an amazing film even without them, full of amazing action scenes, great character moments and mind-blowing special effects. But it truly shines as an ending. If you've seen all the previous films. If you've grown to love these characters. If you've invested yourself in this universe. Then it becomes something life-defining. It becomes a cornerstone. A feature of culture. Something that will be talked about for generations.

A very good film on its own. A great movie. But when you take into account the enormity of the MCU, it becomes something unlike anything else. I wonder if I will ever see a movie like this one in my lifetime. I hope so, but it is not a given. And that fact alone, that uniqueness, that scope, pays for all the praise imaginable.

Thank you, Marvel. Here's to another decade of adventure."
180,JoBloTheMovieCritic,9,Avengers: Endgame,"9/10 - an impressive cast list, an enthralling storyline, and an epic end to an era enables this superhero flick to stand out among the increasing monotony of the genre"
181,dfranzen70,9,Mind blowing,"It seems like there's always a big Movie Event nowadays, like the last Lord of the Rings movie, the last Harry Potter, or the first Stars Wars movie in forever. Each of these movies packs a huge emotional wallop as we see the culmination of story arcs we've been following for several years. With the Avengers, we've been following these arcs for ten years (and now 22 films), and Endgame had the unenviable task of following the cliffhanger of its immediate predecessor. How will the Avengers reverse the Decimation? Well, for starters they'll do so in a three-hour-plus movie - and they'll need every minute, too. But the road to redemption is not a straight one at all, and if you thought that the final scenes in other franchises were powerful...well, in Endgame they happen very frequently. How emotional is this movie? Bearing in mind that it's a comic book movie, not a Hallmark movie, one wouldn't expect only the broadest of 'heavy' scenes, and yet in Endgame these scenes seem to occur every few minutes. How emotional? It used to be that people would rate melodramas based on the number of handkerchiefs they needed to wipe their tears or blow their noses. For Endgame, I'd say it's a five hankie movie, but only if one reuses one's hankie a lot. I counted twelve tear-inducing scenes. 12! But the franchise has always depended, to some degree, on surprises, and luckily for me nothing was spoiled beforehand. In Endgame, we see many, many character arcs completed one way or another. The movie is exceedingly satisfying and emotional draining. It is far and away the finest comic book movie I've ever seen, and I hope it joins Black Panther in garnering itself an Oscar nomination or two next year. There isn't a single moment in this movie that misses a step, no single overwrought or drawn-out scene. There is just moment after moment of awesomeness. Even if you have just a vague idea of what the plot is or who the Avengers are, you probably won't watch this movie without feeling something magical. The characters are well written and exceptionally well played. The action is exhilarating. The ending is cathartic. It's very worthwhile to see this in a theater, too."
182,henry8-3,9,Avenger Still: Endgame,"Picks up 22 days after the climax of Infinity War with Iron Man and Nebula stranded in space and the others baffled as to what to do next. Antman re-emerges and they consider a new possible way forward.

Fabulous conclusion, full of wit, sadness and wonder. Everyone is great, the effects are to die for and a very well produced line is drawn under phase 3 - let's hope phase 4 is half as good."
183,snoozejonc,9,Is that everyone?,"After the events of Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man contacts the Avengers with an idea.

This is a highly enjoyable crowd-pleaser from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

In three hours of running time it covers all the ground required for a worthy end to the infinity stones era.

The story dedicates a lot of quality time to character arcs, whilst also delivering a mcguffin driven sci-fi adventure and an epic final confrontation.

For me the best aspects of the movie are the character moments. In the first hour, by MCU standards, there is a small amount of visual spectacle in favour of focus on individuals and setting up what is to come. This cleverly introduces the stakes and compels the audience to invest in the outcome. It also provides plenty of humorous banter and self-referential comedy. A movie with dialogue that makes fun of its own sci-fi concept and genre categorisation has to be appreciated.

The sci-fi adventure dominates the middle section of the movie as it becomes more plot driven and the action spectacle starts to increase. Whilst it is a lot of fun, I didn't find it as gripping as what came before. There are quite distinct shifts in tone as it cuts from one group of characters to the next, with some scenes feeling ominous, others quite heartfelt and a few played entirely for laughs. I don't think it's badly done, it's just a bit uneven as a result of sending the characters on several different missions and the persistence of using Thor for comic value. If it was taken too seriously and made more elaborate, it could have dragged on for too long or ended up a confusing mess, particularly for viewers who either haven't seen certain other MCU movies or cannot remember their plot details. I think the writers took the right option by keeping it as simple as possible.

It's in the final third of the movie when most of the major spectacle occurs. There is little details I can mention without spoiling, but it is safe to say it's big, heroic, loud, violent, colourful, rousing, and satisfying on an epic scale. Importantly the characters do not get lost amongst the visual effects and there are some wonderfully emotional moments thrown in for good measure.

If you look hard enough there are plot holes and you could question some of the sci-fi, but to take it that seriously and complain about such details would be rather sad. It is three hours of very strong escapism and if you go with the flow you should enjoy.

As usual with Marvel the impressiveness of the production values is off the charts, with a ridiculous amount of superpowers and large scale conflict on display that all look quite real.

All actors produce great performances, particularly Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner, Scarlet Johansson, Karen Gillan and Paul Rudd.

For me it's an 8.5/10 but I round upwards."
184,AudioFileZ,9,Brings It Home Knocking It Out of the Park,"All I can say is that I've never been into the comics but this sets such a high bar maybe I missed out? I'm one who would rather watch the movie it's safe to say. Seriously this is the ultimate escapist celluloid brilliance I've witnessed in over 50-years of movies. This film is the masterpiece of the genre. What a cast too. I think after some settling I will actually feel inspired to go through the entire franchise again knowing this carrot is at the end. No criticism of any kind can I think of. Truly excellent to the point even if you're never seen anything Marvel you should step up and see Avenger's"" Endgame."
185,Amyth47,9,AVENGERS' FANS ASSEMBLE! - Isn't this why we go to the movies for?!,"My Rating : 9/10

This is exactly why people go to sit in a dark room with bright lights bouncing back into their retinas for pleasure!

Now on to the movie - 'Avengers : Endgame' is a finale of sorts of the Marvel Avengers Franchise which started back in 2008 with Jon Favreau's brilliant 'Iron Man' and we are already 21 movies in after 11 glorious action-packed years!

'Avengers : Endgame' is emotional, super funny and lots of little throwbacks to the previous movies for nostalgia value will make this the most talked-about and entertaining movie of the year - There's no place for critics here, it's about the fans' love for the series given justice. If you go looking for plotholes or keep thinking 'well this doesn't make any sense' or 'wow that's dumb' - this isn't for you! All of the MCU movies are romanticist in nature and they are for all ages to enjoy so they can't exactly become too dark or complicated for that matter.

Thumbs Up to the Avengers for making it a happy fan experience (and a bit teary-eyed one)!"
186,rivertam26,9,Satisfying,"This is where everything we've watched comes together and it is a thrilling movie experience. Although still not as good as the original avengers film. It is truly impressive how everything is blended beautifully with a mind flowing finale. Sure the time traveling stuff feels a little unnecessary but it works for the overall story. Its complexity gives all the performers here some inspired moments. I mean it was one hell of an experience being in the theater opening night and watching the audience go insane. This too me feels like the end of these films and although it goes on just a bit too long it ties everything up nicely.

187,one9eighty,9,"The end of great chapter- bravo, I love it 3000","Wow! Concluding an 11 year phase, which has had some 20+ films, ""Avengers: End Game"" is an epic wrap up of various Marvel Universe films and, in particularly, it closes the book from ""Avengers: Infinity War"" which left a lot of cliffhangers.

This film is a roller-coaster of emotions from start to finish, with a massive runtime of at least 3 hours, which is an awful lot. Personally I did not move from my seat for the duration of the film.

All your favorite Marvel characters are present in some way or another. The film is presented in a typical comic book style; lots of the action which is extremely over the top and big, with moments of emotion that have the ability to bring tears to the eyes of even the most hardcore comic book fans. There are plenty of characters, most of which are allowed to have the development time that ""Infinity War"" just couldn't allow for. Sure it doesn't follow the true path laid out in the comics, but then it couldn't - the comic book universe and film universe are two different paths. The film represented itself absolutely brilliantly and gives cinema an epic masterpiece, the likes of which has been lacking for sometime - think ""Ben Hur"", ""Spartacus"", ""Lord of the Rings"" - this is easily along those scales as a generation defining moment. It's a vivid and stylish film with plenty of bang for your buck. I can not rate this lower than a 9/10."
188,fernandoschiavi,9,"""Endgame"" not only delivers a cathartic experience greater than Infinite Warfare, but it also establishes definitive positions regarding the MCU's destinies","Finally, the long-awaited conclusion of a saga that was weaved ingeniously and meticulously for a decade by the House of Ideas, under the command of Kevin Feige. If before the studios practically did not bet on superhero films, ten years ago this reality changed completely when we saw ""Iron Man (2008)"" debut in theaters around the world, beginning a wide, complex and detailed shared universe, which gave life to characters that fans so longed to see transported to the cinema and becoming acquainted with others not so popular even among comic book fans. There were three phases that became known as the ""Infinity Saga"", in which we became intimate with Iron Homme, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange.

Filmed simultaneously with ""Infinite War"", the Russo brothers and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely continue to tell the story of the previous film. Here, superheroes must deal with the events of the previous film, in which half of the people in the galaxy were wiped out at Thanos' snap, including friends and family of our heroes. Those who are left are still, for more than three weeks, trying to locate Thanos who entered a portal and disappeared, while trying to find a solution to reverse what had happened.

The first fifteen minutes invest in revenge and the consummation of failure: an introduction. The next sequences, which make up a first, more melancholic, yet vigorous act in re-presenting characters and renewing the previous status quo, have an emphasis on the intimate, precisely what drives Ultimato as an experience: a great show on a colossal scale, but that cares about a dance, a feeling, a heart, a family.

""Ultimatum"" gets it right by dedicating more than half its duration to intensify the hopelessness, mourning and disbelief that the characters and the audience were going through together. In that time, he takes the opportunity to strengthen ties between unlikely characters, such as Toby Stark and Nebula, and also to show how old friends, such as Natasha, Rogers and Barton, Tony and Thor and Bruce, led their lives five years after the events of the beginning of the movie. The characters have their own layers, monsters and voids, to add to the project itself, which is a mooring of several narrative arches, the sustenance of a three-hour cathartic work. Especially interesting is Tony's bow, living alongside his great love and his little daughter, being the counterpoint to Barton, who had his life transformed after the loss of his family, becoming a vengeful murderer who eliminates those he does not consider worthy. Meanwhile, Carol Danvers went on to help other planets that also suffered from Thanos' actions.

After the presentation of the current situation of each of the heroes, it is when Scott Lang enters the story, who managed to return from the quantum kingdom, after the post-credits scenes that we had followed in ""Ant Man and the Wasp"". He then explains that the laws of physics and space-time do not apply to the quantum realm, theorizing that they could travel through time through the Pym Particles and the portal. From there, after seeing an old photo of him with Peter Parker, Tony ends the time travel equation and the Avengers, with the exception of Danvers, split into groups to return to the past and retrieve the Infinity Stones and that's when Marvel takes audiences on an unforgettable journey celebrating 11 years of their shared universe, revisiting films like ""The Avengers"", ""Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and even the controversial ""Thor: The Dark World"" .

Banner, Rogers, Lang and Stark return to 2012, during Loki's invasion of New York, to retrieve the Tesseract, Loki's scepter and the Eye of Agamotto. They also end up going to 1970 at the S.H.I.E.L.D. in Lehigh to get another version of the Tesseract, which was being tested by the military and to get more particles from Hank Pym, who had just invented them. Meanwhile, Thor and Rocket return to Asgard in 2013 to extract Jane Foster's Reality Gem. Clint and Natasha return to Vormir in 2014 to retrieve the Soul Gem, while Rhodes and Nebula go to Morag, also in 2014, where Peter Quill is about to steal the Gem of Power. This whole time travel will culminate in the great final battle, after Thanos discovering the heroes' plan, where the destiny of the universe will be at stake again.

The cast reaches the height of their characters' understanding, completing a whole development arc. In addition to the main cast, which is already extremely numerous, there are still several cameos from great actors and actresses who showed up in previous productions. Robert Redford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Tilda Swinton, Natalie Portman, William Hurt, are just a few of those names, and some of them literally go silent and leave quietly.

With a million dollar budget of US $ 356 million, the film justifies the use of every penny and obviously will not have any difficulty in recovering and sometimes exceeding the high amount invested. They are effects used for the rejuvenation of characters, the construction of scenarios from different eras and worlds, dozens of intergalactic beings from the most different backgrounds and visual effects of a scale and perfection rarely seen. Not for nothing, ""Ultimatum"" was nominated for an Oscar in the category. Few times have we seen so many characters gathered together, with several actions taking place simultaneously, and everything wonderfully orchestrated by the precise direction of the Russo brothers, who manage to maintain a perfect unity and synchrony. The final battle against Thanos that takes up almost the entire last hour of the three that lasts the film, will be remembered as one of the biggest and most spectacular in the history of cinema. There, we can see the full potential of all the heroes presented by the MCU in these years should be a delight for fans of the universe. Not to mention the emotional and beautifully post-battle scenes that tie up all the last loose ends of the Infinity Saga. The audience is in tears. And it is not a daydream or exaggeration.

The soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, responsible for the famous Avengers theme, composed for the 2012 film, is once again perfect, elevating drama, melancholy and epic action to the tenth power. In the musical part, ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"", by Traffic, ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"", by The Kinks, ""Doom and Gloom"" by the Rolling Stones and ""Hey Lawdy Mama"", by Steppenwolf are some of the songs that are present. The production designer of the always competent Charles Wood and photography by Trent Opaloch, who uses and abuses the darkest filters that give the greatest degree of drama and pessimism that guide much of the feature film are used with mastery.

Throughout the film, the Russo brothers think millimetrically about each scene, sometimes to make the audience cry, sometimes to laugh and sometimes to cheer for the heroes in their battles. As well as the conclusion of the saga ""Harry Potter"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", the great megalomaniac of ""Ultimatum"" will remain in the minds of the moviegoers as one of those epic films that practically everyone has watched. And the end, still holds great surprises, some that envision a future of the Universe, such as those involving Thor and The Guardians of the Galaxy and the passing of Captain America's baton.

""Ultimatum"" works above all expectations: it not only delivers a cathartic experience greater than Infinite Warfare, but it also establishes definitive positions regarding the MCU's destinies. The film proves to have been planned in detail by the studio's creative minds, who know more than anyone else, how to please their audience. Although ""Ultimatum"" seems to be the end of the Infinity Saga, phase 3 will officially end with ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", which should still have consequences for this film in the life of Peter Parker, especially with the death of someone very close and dear to the hero."
189,Benjamin-M-Weilert,9,A fitting and almost perfect end to an epic saga.,"With last year's semi-cliffhanger, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019) had a lot of ground to cover to reach a satisfying conclusion of over ten years of filmmaking. It's no wonder that it's just a smidge over three hours since there's a lot of ground to cover here. I'll admit that the only instantiations of these superheroes that I'm familiar with is via the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Still, it was probably better to go into the finale this way, having no preconceived notions of how the characters should act or the lore they're connected to in the comic books.

For a three-hour movie, Endgame moves at a steady pace that accelerates toward the inevitable conclusion. Following a standard three-act structure, Endgame benefited from bringing all the heroes together in Infinity War and establishing a baseline to work from and a goal to work toward. It was nice to see how each of these characters handled such a dramatic universal event. This is even to the point where some of the character transformations were quite hilarious (Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk is still a gem of the series). With the stakes already established, the collection of heroes felt like they were actually fighting for something instead of just reacting to actions thrust upon them.

While this film lived up to my expectations, a few scenes were far from perfect. In particular, a scene or two felt like it was pandering to the audience and saying, ""Look how progressive we are!"" Sure, it was a neat bit and combined somewhat well with all the other amazing bits around it, but I almost had to groan at how forced it seemed. At the very least, Endgame wrapped up a ton of loose ends that have spanned a multitude of movies and left a definitive conclusion to the most ambitious filmmaking event of a generation.

A fitting and almost perfect end to an epic saga, I give Avengers: Endgame 4.5 stars out of 5."
190,kosmasp,10,Time to play the (end)game,"I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.

My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.

Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?

Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.

And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.

I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.

That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.

Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of course

Edit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway. Popcorn (or Nachos or whatever you prefer) to perfection"
191,tavm,10,Avengers: Endgame was a great way to end the first series of the Marvel Cinematic Univeerse,"If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!"""
192,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10,Smooth landing to an amazing 11 year ride,"This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.

This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.

I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey. And if you're someone who's skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they're simply not to your liking. This is not going to change that. It's not meant to. 10/10"
193,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,10,I watched this movie 3 times in the cinema,"The Infinity War movie was better. I watched this movie 3 times in the cinema. I didn't like it very much when I watched it the first time, but I liked it after watching it. The ending of the movie was a bit sad. The battle scene was epic."
194,UniqueParticle,10,Outstanding visually & epically delightful!,"Very enjoyable IMAX 3D experience! I love the quantum physics involved, very fascinated by it. A lot of funny jokes & devastating stuff. Top tier Marvel movie difficult to talk about without spoiling anything; definitely worth price of admission - love geeking out for a fun awesome movie!"
195,cruise01,10,Spectacular finale to a great long franchise of MCU films.,"Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent awesome superhero film that concludes the infinity stones storyline that has been building up with 22 movies in the Marvel universe. They had done a great job building up each solo character and have there films bring something new and exciting. Endgame is the game changer that delivers the ultimate climax of the story arc with the big bad Thanos (Josh Brolin) going up against the Avengers. After the previous film Infinity War leaving the audience hanging with the cliffhanger. Marvel has done a great job in marketing and keeping this film spoilers free with the trailers that only show the same footage and very minimum. Which I will say it is best to see the film knowing very little about what is going to happen.

I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Endgame is amazing and spectacular. Joe and Anthony Russo direction was fantastic and they did a great job in delivering a spectacular climax of the MCU. The plot was amazing. For a three hour long film. The film does move pretty fast and kind of feels short when watching it. I did feel like Endgame is a little short on the action set pieces like the previous films. Which this film does focus more on the emotional connections with the original Avengers like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and how they were all affected by the aftermath of Infinity War. The film does have a lot of fun and feels like a wild adventure with what these characters go through. The final hour delivers all out with an epic climax which every character has a moment to shine. And makes up for the lack of action in the movie. I love how every hero works with another when fighting there enemy. There were some moments where you will be in an awe and clapping moment with the climatic battle sequence. The visual effects are top notch great. There is some fun humor that will lighten the mood of the film. And there are some tear jerking moments that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. The directors did a wonderful job in surprising the audience with something new and reaching every characters full potential. The climatic fight scene with Thor, Cap America, and Iron Man teaming up and bouncing around with there super powers are just awesome. The surprises do keep on coming throughout. Which will leave you feeling satisfied.

Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. The plot was amazing and fast moving. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited. The cast ensemble was great. I will say this is one fun wild ride that I am happy how it ties the story arc together."
196,Floated2,10,End of an era masterpiece,"In arguably the most anticipated movie of the year and one of the most anticipated movies of all time, Avengers: Endgame was well on its way with all the hype leading up to the film. Having enjoyed Infinity War but thought it could have been better all around, the overall hype for Endgame had its match made. Now having watching this film in theaters as it was a must watch to (due to the 3D experience and also knowing the longer one waited, the more likely spoilers would have been exposed, ruining the experience and essence of the film).

As a film, won't say much but this film delivers on expectations. Had no knowledge of the overall plot but within the first few minutes, one was excited and was there for the thrill of the ride throughout. With a runtime of over three hours (including end credits), the film has a great pace and doesn't feel nearly as long (which is great since something is always happening). Due to its great cast and plethora of characters, there really is never a dull moments and the film is ensured and filled with moments of surprise, suspense, action emotion and overall greatness.

Now the overall plot of time travel was well done and brought back many memories to the other Avenger films. The wait for the film was most definitely worth it, and this film will most doubly become one of the biggest movies of alltime. Will need to see this film probably once more in theaters before its run is over and most definitely will see it again multiple times afterwards to soak in its greatness. Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie, it's a moment - a moment in time. Cherish every moment."
197,matthewssilverhammer,10,I love it 3000,"When Thanos snapped his finger, it shook the world. How could Earth's mightiest heroes avenge the ashen fallen? Could they at all? Would any plan they concoct be plausible, successful, or, most importantly, dramatically satisfying? Now that we're at the Endgame, our fears are meeting the truth, and what a glorious ending it is. This Marvel Universe experiment should've been an unwieldy disaster; just look at what DC failed to do. Producer Kevin Feige has created a hand-wrapped gift to those of us who love epic storytelling. The ""Infinity"" franchise has been a symphonic display of heroism, comedy, pathos and ethos that unbelievably ""concludes"" with its most emotionally substantial film ever. Endgame culminates tears, cheers and years of storytelling into one incomparable piece of epic finale storytelling, the likes of which we're rarely lucky enough to see on the big screen. Unlike most of the Avengers films, the Endgame story lays heavy on its viewers. Dense, long, and somber, it can seem burdensome, until you realize how immaculately constructed and lovingly toned it all is. Each character gets their moment(s), and not just superhero poses and fan service throwaways. They get to be human, making their final standoff not only a battle for the cinematic ages but a heartfelt dramatic timebomb, hearkening recent saga classics like Return of the King or Deathly Hallows. I'm keeping the details light to avoid spoilers, but Endgame is so much more than its individual plot points. The quiet sadness, cheer-worthy action and inspired sparks of humor are too transcendent to be ruined by some words on a digital screen. These superhumans have given us a glorious celebration of the goodness of being human."
198,subxerogravity,10,All Great Things...,"Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one... A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second! Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years. Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around. It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket. Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!"
199,generationofswine,10,An Honest Review,"Walking in, given Marvel's latest publicity, I was expecting, well, I was expecting an absolute cringe fest, and thankfully I didn't get it. In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight.

Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that.

It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment.

So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate.

Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it.

We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film.

The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick.

The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with."
200,sauravjoshi85,10,This gives a perfect and tearful farewell to some of our superheroes.,"Avengers: Endgame is an action, Sci-fi, superhero movie directed by Anthony Russo and Jeo Russo with screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and stars an ensemble cast from almost all the previous MCU movies.

This is the 22nd MCU movie.

In my opinion this could be called as the perfect ending of Avengers series and we might not see some characters in the future MCU movies which also includes one of my Favorite character Robert 'Iron-man' Downey Jr.

The movie stars from where the Infinity war has ended and gives a perfect closure. The screenplay of the movie is written and executed beautifully and despite of the length of the movie, the movie will keep you engaged, the best part of the movie is that the movie will not make you feel about the length.

Acting is great and all the characters were best in their respective roles. The movie had provided enough opportunity to everyone to showcase their talent despite of such a huge Star cast. The climax of the movie gives a perfect closure.

Overall a great movie to watch and gives a perfect ending to the avengers series. A must watch for every avenger fan."
