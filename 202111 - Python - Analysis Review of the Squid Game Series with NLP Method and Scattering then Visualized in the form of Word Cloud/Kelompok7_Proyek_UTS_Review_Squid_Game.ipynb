              "'[\\'I know korea is still a mysoginistic society until now because there government doesnt want women to have power and more equal rights than men and thats the sad truth of the society, but judging the story it felt flat for me the beginning episodes are great BUT after episode 5 it felt DRAGGY and SLOW and i get the betrayal of friends part but i think it feels so injustice of the other characters especially Ali they didi him dirty and still koreans always look down dark or brown skinned people i hate it here and still racist to foreigners ngl though and the ending is still open ended so weed a 2nd season to answer all the several plotholes of previous episodes. Acting is PHENOMENAL HANDS DOWN especially SAEBYEOK i love her role in this its giving me katnis everdeen vibes heheheh purr and GIHUN too i love his kind honest protagonist and especially the front man i love villainess of the characters, high budget production, outfits stages evrything: felt flat for the OST i need lisas money fpr the ost of the 2nd season please it matches the series. Thats all!! yall should watch Alice in borderland it has better plot than the squid game purr.\\'] [\"The show was AMAZING! the way I was crying for characters I have only known them for 1-4 episodes is just crazy cause this is the first time it has happened to me. The way they have developed the characters even if we don\\'t know that much about their background other than gi-hun but honestly, they never tell us anything like why he debt or any other information, so it\\'s crazy how i started crying, this also just proves how the acting is just amazing and i loved the cast and they fit so well with the roles and the chemistry with each other was amazing too! Also, i was so happy seeing a south asian character because it\\'s not very common to see them and even if you do see them they are small roles no main characters so I WAS VERY VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT me being an indian myself. The music was also so good, the song matched the vibe so well such as when they played happy songs in bad situations it really matched well with the children\\'s game theme or the pink soldiers song gave such an eerie vibe but i kept wanting to listen to the song even though it kinda freaked me out a little. Lastly, i loved the story so much but if I\\'m going to be honest, the story was pretty basic but it was still so addicting and i binged the whole show in one sitting so i still TOTALLY RECCOMED WATCHING! i love this show so much and I\\'m SO HAPPY FOR THE SHOW AND THE ACTORS FOR ALL THE INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION THIS SHOW IS GETTING AND OTHER KDRAMAS SUDDENLY GETTING AFTER SQUID GAME... LIKE THE STORIES ARE SO GOOD THEY DESERVE IT!! YAYYYY!!\"] [\\'Squid Game was truly something else. I expected a bunch of games, but did I expect everything that happened during and after the games? No, definitely not. This obviously needs a season 2 since the ending was kind of crappy. Don\\\\\\'t get me wrong, the beginning and the show in general was excellent. However, I wish the ending was a little more developed. Seong Gi Hoon was an interesting character. He was naïve of a sort, even though he was been through a lot. Even after what happened at the end, he continued to live his life the way it was before. Cho Sang Woo honestly did not deserve to last so long in the games. This man was dangerous and we couldn\\\\\\'t even detect it. Kang Sae Byeok was the best character, hands down. She faced everything head-on which is something I want to do whenever I\\\\\\'m in the middle of a situation. Hwang Jun Ho was pretty irrelevant in my opinion because his purpose was to only find his brother who went missing. The hot thing about him was that he always used the words of someone whenever he was \"violated\". There\\\\\\'s no closure about him, which I wish did happen. Hopefully in season 2, we\\\\\\'ll get closure about him. Ali was too innocent in this drama. All he wanted was money for his wife and kid, poor guy couldn\\\\\\'t even get anything, but he left his family a good amount. Oh Il Nam...I don\\\\\\'t know, I have a confusing view about him. He treated the guys so nice, but at the end what he explained was messed up. Ji Yeong was also badass, her ending is undeserved, she deserved a second chance. There\\\\\\'s a bunch of other characters I would have reviewed, but meh it\\\\\\'s whatever lol\\'] [\"It\\'s competent in most aspects. The hype honestly makes it a worse experience, because you expect something mindblowing and genre breaking. It\\'s not that. It\\'s Battle Royale Fall Guys. It\\'s mostly enjoyable. The social commentary is a bit heavy handed at times, but it\\'s nice to have it there. It\\'s not that original, it\\'s not perfect. It\\'s fine.  (random note: The scenes with English speaking foreigners were hilarious. The writing was mostly ok, but it didn\\'t come off as entirely natural. And combined with not-stellar acting it felt odd. I guess like Asian scenes feel in western movies maybe.)\"] [\"yeah. Worth the hype. I wasn\\'t wowed by the first episode of this drama, nor entirely enchanted by the second. But by the end of the second episode I thought... dang, okay, fine, I guess I want to keep watching. And I\\'m glad I did. The most thrilling and emotional parts of this show took place within the game itself. The games are simple children\\'s games, but are games that don\\'t necessarily require skill. Most of the time, it\\'s luck; which number you drew, which shape you got, that sort of thing. The game purports to be \\'fair\\', but it\\'s only fair in the way that real life is fair. You\\'re stuck with the cards you\\'ve been given. The poor characters take part in the game because the real world is so terrible for them that the game is the best alternative they\\'ve got. Sadly, some even think they can win, despite (as we\\'ve discussed) the games being largely luck-based. The characters are mostly pretty decent in this. The main character, Gi Hoon, is initially kind of a piece of trash, but you realize that he\\'s a gambling addict, and this leads to him hurting the people he loves. He\\'s not an inherently bad person who wants to hurt others, and you see that come out in the game, where he\\'s one of the kinder people there. The rest of the cast are also great, not a weak performance in sight. I\\'d say the cop\\'s plotline and character are mildly confusing and vague and you\\'re just not that emotionally invested in it compared to everyone else. The show continues to get better and better as the games keep going and people die.\\\\nPeople die in very emotionally impacting ways, and I think they did all the character deaths very well. They often feel different too; whether it\\'s because it was accidental, somebody cheated so they lost, or just bad luck. And the deaths can weirdly almost feel like a part of their character arcs. I don\\'t know how the writers pulled it off but they did it well. tl;dr it\\'s really worth watching because it\\'s not just trashy fun, it has so much to say about the unfairness of the systems in this world that keep poor people down. I\\'m not sure I\\'d rewatch it because it\\'s so emotionally overwhelming at times but it is super good.\"] [\"Average for it\\'s genre.  Don\\'t get me wrong, this is a pretty decent show. But at the same time the ending didn\\'t satisfied me at all. It ended like this in order to have more seasons ofc but idk... for me it lacked smt. Survival movies or tv shows are never a concept i find revolutionary, so i think it\\'s pretty funny how of all the kdramas out there, this one is the most watched on Netflix. Not only that but it\\'s the TOP2 most watched shows on Netlix of all time. I understand everything and all that, but if i ever survived such a crazy hell i would either end up killing myself regardless or just really living and doing everything i\\'ve ever wanted. Might as well... what\\'s the worst that can happen?\"] [\\'I watched this on the spur of the moment after having 0 intention of watching it previously, because tbh how many times have manga/anime fans seen this survival game concept? Growing up with Japanese entertainment, NOTHING about this show was new at all, but I still loved it. I suppose for Westerners it might be new, but for me the shock factors or disturbing qualities didn\\\\\\'t stand out from originality but from the pure execution. I could say the majority of the plot turns were predictable as well but the pacing and performances were SO good, that it kept me on the edge of my seat. The violence/gore wasn\\\\\\'t emotionally or mentally straining and was easy to get to used to after the initial shocks of the first two episodes. I LOVED the detective. Passionately :D and not just because that man is incredibly fine, but his character addition really added to the quick pacing of the show, mixing in another storyline so as to almost give us a breather from the dirty inhumane warehouse feeling the other characters endured. I believe that the alternations of character/story focuses was what was really done well because it always kept you rolling and focused. A \"next, next, next action\" experience. The only reason I\\\\\\'m not giving it a 10 is because I really felt that the ending of some characters was rushed. Episode 8-9 definitely lacked the full emotional appeal of loss for me and I was mildly disappointed but I understand there was a time crunch. I\\\\\\'ve never stayed up all night to watch a show before, but I did for Squid Game. I was absolutely groggy the next day but it was worth it. I\\\\\\'m currently rewatching it with my mom, and it is still an incredibly crisp viewing. The camerawork and colors were executed very, very well and I look forward to watching Hwang Dong Hyuk\\\\\\'s other works. The \"novelty\" of Squid Game that\\\\\\'s all over media is 100% Western hype in my opinion, but tbh with how well done this show was, it probably deserves it.\\'] [\"I wasn\\'t sure at first that this would be for me, I\\'m usually more of a romance based story lover, but this really surprised me. Squid game has no romance, and I wasn\\'t bothered in the least about it. I was just an interesting story with morally grey compelling characters. I\\'m a bit confused about the ending. I\\'m not sure if they did it that way so that there could possibly be another season or just to make the viewer think? But overall, this kept me very engaged and I really liked it a lot! If the creators were to do another show set in this world, I would LOVE to see more about how it started, how the workers are chosen and just more about the frontman. The frontman had the potential to be a really interesting character, the story just wasn\\'t focusing on him. I just want to know why he chose to join the game maybe even (SPOILERS) see what his original game was like and ultimately led him to abandon his family and become a major part of the game.\"] [\"A brilliant show fully worth watching. This is a show that is simultaneously brutal and beautiful in its depiction and execution. It\\'s a fantastic metaphor for capitalism and the illusion of autonomy, the compulsion to survive that drives the poorest when their supposed freedoms and choices are constrained by a need to survive. Anyone could have left the game but out in the real world, the pressures would not let them. So they stayed and played.  I thought Gi-Hun was a weak and unsympathetic character, I didn\\'t like the actor\\'s constipated expressions at everything and I thought the support cast was better in terms of sympathetic characters and acting. The plot itself was formulaic but still great. Lot of the deaths were foreshadowed but that often made the prelude thick with emotional suspense and a desperation to be proven wrong. The games were brutal and I thought in particular that episodes 4 and 7 were masterful. Again, I felt let down by the main character and I also found everything on the side with the undercover policeman to be an unnecessary addition which could instead have been devoted to fleshing out the back stories of some of the other characters. I found the North Korean defector (sorry i can\\'t remember her name) the most interesting whilst Ali and the old man were the most endearing. This show really though could only be endured if you hated the characters. As soon as you began liking someone, they were bound to die.\"] [\"Copied storyline with a weird ending and way too much blood. I watched this, because everyone keeeps talking about this series.Postitive points: Very good production, high quality. The actors gave a great performance. Really can\\'t say anything bad about that! Negative points: The whole story is just.... well it reminds me a lot of Alice in Borderland. Expect that Alice in Borderland was a lot better in my opinion. The ending of Squid game is kinda predictable and not satisfying at all. There isn\\'t really a happy ending for anyone. Tbh i don\\'t get the hype. There are way better Korean/ Asian series out there. Still, I think it\\'s cool that people start recognizing Korean / Asian series/ movies more :) If you like blood, gore and mind f*ck this series is for you, if you don\\'t, better watch something else.\"] [\\'Squid Game is one of the most exciting series to hit Netflix in some time. It mashes up the carefree, idyllic days of childhood with the brutal realism of adulthood as it forces everyday people to compete in life or death matches in a bid to potentially wipe out their debts. Equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing, it’s a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer. It’s one of the most unique things you’ll watch this year -- and maybe ever.\\'] [\\'Show was lame, very weirdly paced and slow. It wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee. Dont follow the hype either. Idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there. Alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense. You dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show. This show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as BR. Skip this or watch if your bored.\\'] [\"The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I\\'ll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I\\'m out.\"] [\"Starts off pretty well in the first episode. Then it\\'s just downhill and pointless. The ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crap It turns out everything is dread, nothing has any meaning, and no one gets happy for anything. Doom, gloom and bad acting is all you get.\"] [\"After now over 2000 unhelpfuls. Here we go again. Guys I don\\'t know what to say. Squid game is not a good show. It\\'s garbage. I hope there won\\'t be a season 2, a spin off or a movie.\"] [\"Watch the first episode if you can\\'t resist the marketing hype. You\\'ll see it\\'s a 3/4. But since these few points - due to the fresh storyline - are undeserved (it\\'s heavily inspired by the manga-anime Kaiji, and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies), I\\'ll give it a 1. Abysmal overacting, puppet characters, unrealistic and unrefined stuff. Even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it\\'s trash.\"] [\"Sadly and stupidly I watched every episode.  Easily predictable on what happens and who\\'s who. The acting is woeful with even worse dubbing. If I can remember who recommended this to me, i\\'d throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting 9 hours of my life on utter dross. It\\'s not unique it\\'s not different. It\\'s all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surprise. If I can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done. \"] [\"Could not relate to the story or any of the characters. Just didn\\'t even care who lives, who dies. Loopholes in the story galore. Unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. In the end was like *yawn* whatever. No issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. This felt like it is riding on the wave movies like Parasite created for Korean cinema/TV. Bloated overhyped nonsense at best. Give it a skip and save your time.\"] [\\'Could barely get through the first 30 mins of this. Extremely boring, cheesy, unstimulating,... I kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on... a lot of over acting. I do not understand what the hype is all about.\\'] [\"This is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games. Don\\'t want just waste of time.\"] [\"Only a sociopath will like watching something like this. The show has very negative energy and it affects the audience. If you don\\'t realise that I\\'m sorry for you. I love thrillers and horror movies if they have a point in them. This is too much because there are literally so many people living in debt especially now during COVID and the suicide rates have skyrocketed because of it. This is not funny, nor interesting, nor enjoyable to watch!\"] [\\'Therefore I vote it in the gutter, because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it.\\'] [\"The talk and reviews have me bewildered, I\\'m only up to Ep3 but am struggling after about 5 attempts to start bingeing. I find it boring and really childish, with pretty ordinary acting. The set design, art direction and general production values are very 1970\\'s. Two more attempts then I\\'ll give up.\"] [\"It\\'s really not that good, highly predictable and the ending was terrible. I will say though, the main character and his acting wasn\\'t too bad, enjoyed watching him, but other than that, it\\'s a waste of time. Anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series.\"] [\"Let me preface: no, I am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can\\'t wrap my head around the hype. Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc. So I\\'m thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it\\'s new or innovating. Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there\\'s only one winner. In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste. Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not. I didn\\'t enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. I\\'d suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be.\"] [\\'First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes \"Kamisama no iu tôri.\" It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.  Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i\\\\\\'ve always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. It\\\\\\'s hard to connect with the story and the actors when they\\\\\\'re expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.\\'] [\\'The show was decent, worth watching but not as great as some are saying. Took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing. Get ready for season 2.\\'] [\"You know, not that bad considering overhype. Ephemera, no more, but has a good picture, music and let\\'s say not so banal development of events( of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer, but for most series and viewers), let\\'s say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement (usually it is so). Strongest side of this series is an acting, it is really solid. I think, considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as 1.\"] [\\'A hype is a hype is a hype... and our actual societys\\\\\\' Zeitgeist. The series is far away from the mentioned \"masterpiece\". Its starts very good, the first 3 parts are very enjoyable, but then it goes down quite quickly. Everything is far too obvious, from the beginning everything is so clear, not one single surprise to the end, and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline, the bad dialogues and the overacting. Furthermore full of plotholes, another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes. All in all nothing special.\\'] [\"How is this currently on a score of 8.2? The lead character was SO annoying in the first 30 minutes that I switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through. It\\'s not a patch on either Battle Royale or the American version of that, Hunger Games. It drags on and on and on, and the ending is just flat. Watch it if you must because of the binge/hype value, but it has little to offer any serious film buff.\"] [\\'Good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated.\\'] [\\'...But then I saw the American actors that play a role and I knew that all the acting was really bad. Starts off shocking and kinda intriguing and fades into being dumb and boring. Had a hard time paying attention by the end.\\'] [\\'Good theme, but story developed in a bad way. POOR DIRECTION Idle for 2hr movie release than that of an 9episode series.\\'] [\\'I loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe.\\'] [\\'A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American). They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained.\\'] [\\'I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it\\\\\\'s nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the \"kill game\" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera.\\'] [\\'This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting. It uses \"Hunger Games\" as it\\\\\\'s base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of \"actors\" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it\\\\\\'s meant to be!\\'] [\\'A tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses. Combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to.\\'] [\\'For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you\\\\\\'ll definitely notice and say when you\\\\\\'re watching \"that character is me!\".  It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others. The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth. As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. That they only find pleasure in people suffer.\\'] [\\'When he finally wins some money...only to lose it 3 seconds later, i turned it off and didnt come back for a while. But eventually I did and it is pretty good. Of course it drags 30 minute episodes into 1 hour long episodes..but its still good. Both twists were so predictable. The police brother and the old man were so obvious...and what is the message of the show...Being rich is just awful...lol Korea must have lots of poor people.\\'] [\\'Squid game is a great TV show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money. The TV show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money. I enjoyed the TV show: it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes. Some mysteries also and some big revelations. I enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch. I will recommend anyone to watch this TV Show. It was quite good.\\'] [\\'Perfect to binge watching, this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted, twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments. While not really perfect, this is a perfectly fine Netflix entertainment. Totally recommended!\\'] [\"Its different but the same basically a different take on the violent game shows were nobody really wins. Episode 6 was the best episode. If there\\'s a season two it needs to be the revenge.\"] [\"If you enjoy Korean movies then this is a must see. Has become a real hit, cool idea, interesting games and drama. Plenty of story to continue more seasons , I\\'ve got final 2 EPs left but have really enjoyed up to this point.\"] [\\'Typical Korean ott actionand some real life back stories thrown in for good measure.

There were a couple of moments where I thought the story dragged a little, however it was all added for tension I\\'m sure. It was absolutely stunning to look at and really well done.

Similar story attempts have been made in the past, but this one has a great blend of Drama with a little unpleasantries.\\'] [\"Wow!! No show has ever stressed me out as much as this one. It was seriously insane and crazy and hilarious all at once. Kept me on the edge of my seat that\\'s for sure. It had me laughing and crying and terrified.\"] [\\'Well directed, pretty good writing, uneven acting (partly over the top theatrical, partly just as it should be), well produced and shot, keeps viewers\\\\\\' attention, slightly predictable at moments (and in general), masterfully edited and with an appropriate music score. As the tile says: good watch (but only once, since then you\\\\\\'ll know \"the secret\", and the mystery will be gone forever).\\'] [\\'Really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. Started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the VIP stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. Has great production values and acting. Episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how Season 2 will turn out.\\'] [\\'This was a generally ok show. Very typical of an anime series. Just another game show game where people fight it out to the death. Some sets were stupid like the arcade machines that could wipe surveillance footage of people in a hallway magically with one random arcade button. None of that \"typey typey break the code and delete\".. just.. \"okay this button should probably be pre-programed to erase evidence of stuff...  ended up not EVEN being a part of the end story plot. Yo.. hello. Anyone listening? No answers on the harvest body parts?? Just the \"you can sell them or eat them, I don\\\\\\'t care but....\" part. Then boom that entire plot is gone. Seriously, I have picked apart this entire series and it\\\\\\'s just absolutely a typical live action anime, bad dub and all. I can\\\\\\'t tell if the actors sucked of if it was the voice over actors ... First episodes drew me in as something new but series left me feeling like I just watched another dumb anime, not an exciting drama with original characters. This show revealed a lot to me about how people stereotype the rest of the world based on racist stereotypes... Is all media propaganda in some way or another?\\'] [\\'In the first 2 episodes, there was a sense of potential in the series but as it progresses, it felt like the scriptwriters are just adding cliches. Not something I would expect from a Korean drama. I expected it to be unique, not your usual survival-themed series, and you know the type that gets you thinking. Everything about this screams American: storyline, predictability, acting, character development? (If there is any), and concept. It was lackluster and I honestly was cringing just wishing it to be over. I predicted almost everything except Gong Yoo’s role. The casts are great! Star-studded even. But when those foreigners started acting, I had the hardest cringe of my life. They made a bad series even worse. I’m not ecstatic for a season 2 but I can already smell a possible storyline. Not to mention Lee Byung-hun’s brother who I presumed to be alive because the gunshot is not fatal. I’ll give season 2 the benefit of the doubt but I’m really sorry coz this season is not worth my time.\\'] [\\'Probably the most horrible acting I have EVER! Seen. The writers of this probably wear goat masks and blow each-other just like in the show. The storyline is so bad that I think Netflix should start recruiting people in grade 3. If they don’t already. By the way that idea is patent pending lol. I think I will run a series where Netflix employees are given certain castings then imprisoned to play games to the death. That is yet another great idea just within a review! Cheers.\\'] [\\'Compelling, visually intriguing, exciting, fast paced and innovative. It has all the right credentials, apart from the inane and unnecessary violence. I don’t give a jot for all the reviews that say it’s a clever commentary on society today. It is not. It is a show that does nothing other than glorify death for no reason whatsoever. Any clever commentary could have been communicated without the need for death. And worse the volume of people who are raving about it. What does that say about our society? That so many are utterly unaffected by such gratuitous murder - that it’s justifiable? That their lives were of no value and expendable just because they were financially ruined? I didn’t get what moral this show was trying to teach me, but surely there has to be some deeper truth to justify such macabre storytelling. I watched one episode and that was enough. Shame on you Netflix for peddling such brutality.\\'] [\\'One of the worst shows of the genre. The one star given is for aesthetics, but other than that the series delivers nothing more than a combination of ideas from other survival game dramas and movies. Besides the dramatic acting approach and impressive setting, the series failed to deliver its messaging despite wanting to appear deep and introspective. Mildly annoyed by how many perceive this show to be more clever and introspective than it is.  Many aspects are not explained well, or there’s really no meaning behind them at all.\\'] [\\'Not a fan of whole killing spree but the series was off to a good start with recruiting and with games. But major bummer was the end. Wth was that ending? Throughout the series it was conveyed to the audience the 456 is a good man except in marble game and then he just idling with his life for one whole year without fulfilling the promises he made for the last 2 dying ones in the game when he had billions in his account. Ending was pathetic to the point make me feel it was such a waste of time watching all that. There are unwanted scenarios in the series.\\'] [\\'The idea of story is genius, smart but sorry to say i dont like this film because to many provide sadistic, violence, inhuman. Many students of my country talking and interesting about this movie although their age are  not enough and not allowed to see the movie. Hope if this film will be released in 2 series...could you please make it with softly?  Because your movie inspired many people..thank you and success for your team\\'] [\\'I left the first episode with pain in my chest…literally. This show is not smart, not entertaining and an unfortunate representation of what we are expected to believe: that money and hate over-rule humanity. Netflix does not fail in releasing one show after the other that depict the big lie; that humanity knows nothing but hate, jealousy, betrayal, anger and filth. The truth is that humanity is capable of so much love, but we will never see that on yet another mass propaganda channel. Please spend your time spreading the right messages, serving the world to be a better place and indulging in good, smart and uplifting content…NOT this.\\'] [\"The filming and pace is okay, but most characters are inconsequential and lackluster. There\\'s no real meaningful character development in this series. Many promising characters starting out, but most ended up being just plot devices to get the story moving. Virtually nothing will change if you swap some of the main characters out. Games are also extremely bland compared to similar pieces like Liar game or Alice in Borderland. Considering there are (without giving spoilers) quite a few a games and they take up significant amount of the screen time, the fact that there are almost no clever design to these games and how they play out is very disappointing. It is an okay series as pastime. However if you compare it to any serious predecessor in the genre, this one is quite pale in comparison especially at its core.\"] [\"If you like watching people get killed while playing children games for money at any cost to win or gamble w/their life to get out of a financial  crisis. Then this is your  Netflix TV series movie.  I found it to be downright disturbing considering the world we live in today it definitely fits into the grand scheme of things during this pandemic. What people will do for money especially when you are forced to make that decision. It shows who has morals or not.  In conclusion, definitely not my cup of tea but maybe someone else\\'s flavor.\"] [\\'But the story suffers in the ending. The reaction of the protagonist became abnormal to the point of him trying to kill a dying man on his deathbed (can he be a little compassionate like when he wanted to just stop the last game because he suddenly grew a conscience), talking slowly when he saw his mother lying on the floor (the normal reaction is to call for help immediately), and him living like a beggar for a year, not using his winnings. The ending would have been better when the last part was the scene from the atm, showing the whooping amount he earned.\\'] [\\'The main character is boring and relies on luck too much. The sets are creative but the characters have such basic and cookie cutter arcs. Not to mention the parts with the doctor player were extremely boring, and many unnecessary scenes were added. The reveal at the end and the purpose of the squid game didn’t really have an effect. For me, it led to sort of a “so what” conclusion. A good show to kill time if you’ve got not much else to watch.\\'] [\"Made it through most of episode 2 before bailing.  No sympathy for self-inflicted losers sob stories, and no interest in seeing the suffering they cause others.  The girl or the mother were the only redeeming characters, and watching them suffer offers no joy.  Don\\'t care what happens to deranged gamblers, so why watch?  The acting is melodramatic caricatures, more cartoonish than appealing, and the concept is just absurd. The production values are high so 2 stars for that. Just personal opinion.\"] [\\'The whole drama is vibrant, all actors performance is awesome, bringing the drama to a different level.\\'] [\\'Its a good show but very sexist towards women. it showing young kids that men are stronger than women its disgusting. It will make girls feel like they cant grow up to stand up for themselves. They make women seem less than. Overall should empower women more as their are a lot of women out their who work their but off to fight and be strong!! Overall good show also is this off how Korea treats those who are poor? Should have made women to be seen as more confident and stronger\\'] [\"The premise itself is good and the first few episodes are well-executed, but there\\'s a bit of a cultural clash regarding some of the tropes and the characters\\' mindsets when presented to a western audience. Egalitarianism between the sexes isn\\'t as progressed in Korea, so the repeated emphasis on the female players being weaker, undesirable teammates was pretty grating.\"] [\\'The ending was very disappointing, after such a large amount of character development I expected better. You do get to grow fond of characters, and there are many anticipated plot twists. Some points in the storyline seemed like they were tied off hastily, somethings were left with lackluster if any answers. Not sure if it’s a ploy to lead up to a second season, but I found myself literally angry at the end. For a character’s entire motive to just be abandoned at the last minute is just irritating. Redemption was available many times over for the main character, just to be fumbled and squandered. Production was gorgeous though. The VIPs would be more tolerable without any lines, as they remained anonymous and got away ultimately nothing would have been missed.\\'] [\"i binged it the entire day, and it was good but i didn\\'t like the ending too, but the acting was amazing plus the set\"] [\\'It’s wacky… it’s sappy… it goes from slapstick zany to blood splattering gruesome… and emotionally fluctuates with really extreme characters/situations. It’s kind of all over the place. In my opinion, it was ok. There were some characterizations and stereotypes that I found slightly offensive, and there were some elements that were so illogical, it completely pulled my focus out of the main actions. When a group of certain special people arrive, I think it gets kind of dumb. The colors and aesthetics of the costume/set design are stunning, but I think some of the masks are just way over the top.  I love mask. I’ve made masks, and often wear large obnoxious masks at Halloween parties. I know how cumbersome and uncomfortable they can get. There’s no way some of the characters in the show would be wearing those gaudy, hot, heavy masks all the time. That said, the characters are mostly engaging, and story is bizarre enough to keep one watching till the end.\\'] [\\'A lot of people that is new to the genre might find this show entertaining. Personally, I enjoyed some parts of this show. But most of the time,  I find myself questioning the simplicity of the games itself, the shallow plotline, building up moral compasses that leads to nowhere, and disappointing character developments (yeah i am talking about the main character: he is as selfish as he was during the first episode and the last episode).\\'] [\\'This is the first time I am putting my review for any TV series. Squid Game is definitely an engaging and intriguing series and a binge watch for all. The twist in the end was great, as I never saw that coming and the ending of the first season tells us that a second season is om its way soon.\\'] [\\'this series is very interesting and definitely keeps you wanting to watch more just because the events happening in the show. but honestly i had to watch the show in incriminates because if i watched too much at once I’d get sick to my stomach because this show is pretty gruesome. It shows pretty rough things and honestly makes you think how it’s rated #1 on Netflix right now. Personally I think no one under the age 15/16 should watch this series because of the events that happen. anyone with trauma i don’t think should watch this either because of the scenes. I don’t want to ruin anything for anyone who reads this but warning to all its gruesome.\\'] [\"I would like to write an honest review. I\\'m not going to write what people seeing on internet about show. Truth is, it was a good series no doubt. Acting skills are so damn good. But, it obviously bored you in last 2 episodes. Where there is need of adreline rush obviously. Episode 3, 4, 5,6 are best in the entire series. I would like to suggest you people, do not follow the hype created about the show on social network media. There are other series and movie better than that, but didn\\'t get praised. All those hype they had created on social media is paid. N one mormost important thing, i fall sleep watching this show twice. Now you can conclude on your own.\"] [\\'The first few episodes were captivating, mostly for the shock factor. But unfortunately I think it fell off entirely after episode six (which is meant to be very sad, but how can we feel that sad for anyone when we have become so desensitised to people dying already?). There were a few \"should we just skip?\" moments in the last two episodes due to the drag. After finishing the show I felt a little unsatisfied. Overall it was a well produced show and showcased some brilliant acting; even if the story falls off at the end. Still worth a watch.\\'] [\"The only negative point of this series is it\\'s too slow plus many of the scenes are streched very unnecessarily. For eg:- in last episode, there\\'s a two way communication and it is been streched continuously for half and hours and it\\'s damn boring. I don\\'t know what the makers were thinking, they might have thought that yes we\\'re creating great suspense but no you\\'re making the audience feel bore. The positive things are the sets and performance. Every actor just killed it in their role. Also the sets were designed very beautifully for the task.\"] [\"The show has some really brilliant scenes but in the end comes to a predictable and tame ending. The ending could\\'ve been so much more. I would say a good watch for creative and concept value. As well as the performances by the entire cast.\"] [\"Not a bad series but highly overated in my opinion. The story is old but the acting is superb. Cruelty is similar to Saw and Tarantino. A lot of moral dilemmas arise as the show progresses. The uniforms and the playground songs are well placed. Not recommended for anyone under 18. It can be rough for audiences that don\\'t like death games movies\"] [\"It is disturbing, gross and insane. The show isn\\'t binge worthy if you\\'re easily triggered by violence. Deep down it is a lesson how nostalgia & the urge to make money can actually kill you.\"] [\"The series had a motive of showing the people that they are actually different kinds of animals in the world.

Humans always  consider for their selves  first  and then their loved ones. This series will give you how people are seen in different situations when they are placed.

I have never left a review on any show I’ve ever watched in my entire life but I recommend this show to everyone. The plot is not predictable which I find very intriguing. Kudos to the creators because this show, it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society. Not only does this show keep you hooked, but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole. With all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one I’ve seen to date. There are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all I highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you.

Albeit this show is extremely emotionally and mentally draining, it truly is personally moving and simply amazing work done by the writer/creator, production staff, director and actors whom simply make this show one of the greatest film or movie I’ve ever laud witness to. The character building alone is that of legendary status while each of the main casts actors are so perfectly cast and act their roles in ways I didn’t expect. This isn’t just a Korean hunger games by any means but more like a human case study on our nature and society as human beings.

It keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you can\\'t stop watching!! One complaint I have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field  (*cough* clickbait *cough*) but Squid Game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective.

It really pushes you to think out of the box and questions your personal belief of humanity, life, relationship, and most importantly, how far an individual is willing to go for money even though if it requires the harshest of sacrifices.\\'] [\"this is the definition of a binge-worthy show!! haven\\'t seen a drama for a while, the storys usually seem to get repetitive and quite predictable but not this one! apart from the fact that it was obvious the protagonist would survive since the story revolved around him, every episode was packed with twists at every turn, really had me on up my toes!! it was so refreshing to watch a such a clever and well-thought out drama with some very thought-provoking life lessons ! the cast, needless to say, made it all the more worth watching.. i am a korean drama addict but squid game really has the potential to get anyone hooked! its that good!\"] [\"I have never written a review for a show before, but this one was so good that I honestly just had to, especially since I finished the series in 2 days! Unlike Alice in Borderland, which many claim to be similar to this show, Squid Game truly makes you feel connected to the characters, which ultimately makes their demise all the more heartbreaking. The show is not as gory as some Japanese counterparts, but definitely does make you feel uneasy/unsettled. Love how the show ties together children\\'s games and twists them into something far more sinister. I truly hope to see a Season 2 soon!\"] [\"Wow, I was truly blown away by this amazing series. Every single thing about this show draws you in and it keeps you hooked. I stayed up way later then I should\\'ve when having to go to work the next day, just to keep watching. The acting couldn\\'t be better, the idea is similar to others, but this one is still so original at the same time. It had a little bit of every genre in this to where I know anyone would end up liking this series. I\\'ve really been enjoying a lot of the South Korean series that netflix has been streaming lately. I hope they keep it up and I will be so upset if this doesn\\'t get a season 2!!\"] [\"I finished this series in just 1 day! It keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you can\\'t stop watching!! One complaint I have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field  (*cough* clickbait *cough*) but Squid Game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective. The acting and character development is so good, you really feel for the characters which makes their demise that much more devastating.\"] [\\'It keeps you on the edge but I feel it is overrated.  The old man is wise and it is nice to learn of the games Korean people play. We have same safe games in Zimbabwe.  ..however I think this is just an evil show.  Could be made better- maybe dismis players who loose instead of killing them. What does it teach one about soul. I feel a human life is important and should not be toyed with.\\'] [\\'Yes the acting was good. Playout of the enitre story was good too. Everything was great, EXCEPT the story line. It was an exact replica of HUNGER GAMES. we have seen it before.\\'] [\\'This drama to me, it illustrated the diminishing of human values and norms. It depicts what really happens in our society regardless of where you at; geographically.  The rich seems to be above the law, they get away with a lot of things.  They prey on the poor. What a sad society.  So sad.\\'] [\\'The movie is not that great, it’s entertaining enough to watch. I was so excited when I saw the trailer but the series is disappointing.\\'] [\"Concept was really cool, there were parts in there that were quite exciting - however, didn\\'t like the character development (especially the end).\"] [\\'Great start, badly wrapped up. Entertaining, great visuals\\'] [\\'The general idea of the story is a combination of famous movie clichés and horror series.\\\\r\\\\nThe side stories of the series were practically incomplete and without context.\\'] [\\'Great concept and could have been brilliant but the character development and story telling are really bad. Very unrealistic scenarios. Shame...\\'] [\\'Perfect, Beautiful and lovely...\\'] [\\'The first few episodes were fun to watch as they played out but as the series progressed, a more serious, ominous storyline starts to unfold due to viewers empatheticly connecting with a few of the characters facing uncertainty as the game continues, even possible death? I found the series in the overall really great, refreshingly new and well planned out as it unfolded. I hope that somehow the series will continue on into the future with many more seasons to come? A great show from my perspective!\\'] [\"One of the most beautiful series I\\'ve ever seen, finished in a few days one episode led to another and the desire to follow the series increases more and more. The tension is built very well game by game and the main characters are really well developed.\"] [\\'\"Squid Game\" is definitely a slow burn in its first 2 episodes (but they do give you a taste of what\\\\\\'s to come). As for the rest of the season, you probably won\\\\\\'t be able to stop watching thanks to its story, characters, thrills, twists, games and, of course, gore.\\'] [\"I\\'ve watched the whole lot and it\\'s just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don\\'t know why I watched it all. I\\'m sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It\\'s really woeful.\"] [\"Squid Game is a different type of show and I\\'m all for it! I really liked watching this the hidden message seems to be about the crisis of debt in south korea and just how far some desperate people are willing to do for some cash. I thought it was a very intense adventure that was followed, such an entertaining craft this show has been made into. I avoided the reviews upon watching, instead i decided to give it a go and I\\'m glad i did as its very engaging to the point you cannot watch one episode, this is definitely a bingeworthy one to catch as soon as possible, before the internet ruins it for you. I definitely recommend watching this, some moments will have you laughing although others will have you the complete opposite, it got me good on some parts in both ways. Check it out! Now on Netflix!\"] [\\'Believe the hype this is one of the best shows to ever hit Netflix. Every episode gets better and better and the acting is spot on. The action scenes are beautiful the whole concept is crazy but in this case crazy works.\\'] [\\'I bought into the hype and watched this mess. I am very confused about what people see in it. I can look past the horrible over acting by the VO artists, stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development. I stuck it out until the end and was completely let down. By far, the worst finale of any series in history.\\'] [\"I really don\\'t get the hype. Done 5 episodes now and find it all rather boring. Maybe I was expecting too much when someone told me it similar to Battle Royale....?\"] [\\'I fail to see what got people so hyped about this. It is slow, veeeeryyy predictable, characters not relatable at all, long winded bathetic (yes that is a word) scenes, borderline annoying characters, no skill or smarts needed only luck, very poorly written \"twists\" that fail to be twists and so on... This is a huuuggeee disappointment.\\'] [\"The peer pressure made me watch this. I wish this show came out about 10 years ago as some small part was predictable but was I surprised? Oh boy,I definitely was. Don\\'t need a second season, but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies. This was brilliant!\"] [\"A number of excellent films have come out of South Korea over the past decade or so. Now this, a blinder of a TV series. Absolutely fantastic. Was thinking of cancelling Netflix but glad I didn\\'t.\"] [\\'Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2. Really entertaining we were very roped in the whole time! Emotional at times. Check it out!!\\'] [\"I watched Episode 1 on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series, and they were absolutely right. I was captured right away. The series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing. Beware, cause there is more than enough violence in the series, and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters, at the same time that you despise others. Keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events. You probably won\\'t see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often. The best thing about this series is the acting. My mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances. There are true Emmy or Oscar level performances throughout the show. One of the best series I\\'ve watched in a long time.\"] [\\'I wanted to like this. I love Asian film and TV from most of their countries, and this entry started interesting enough but even some of the initial elements forbode what my instincts told me would be a lame ending, thus maintaining the \"we don\\\\\\'t care what we put out\" tradition of crappy Netflix fare. 9 hours to a horrible disappointing payoff. It started to go off the rails and become a self righteous preachy mess around episode 4. I won\\\\\\'t give away the ending but I warned you, though I\\\\\\'m sure the lemmings who follow anything will applaud it.\\'] [\\'Bad acting and foolish composition. I just cannot grasp why people rate this over 5 points. Really. If it dosent take more than something like this to get great rating, the quality perception has really deteriorated during the pandemic.\\'] [\"I seriously don\\'t know what the hype is all about. Is it because people get killed while playing a game? Is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey? Because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better. To me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long.\"] [\"Started well. But mid way through, it gets tired and feels sluggish. The games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc. The ending was horrible and vague.It shows that losers will be losers even after winning. Just not relevant in today\\'s world.\"] [\\'Nothing more than a Korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc. Terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes. Probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy, Anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time.\\'] [\\'This show has a great script, excellent actors, but fails to keep the viewers interested, because it is really slow. I often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer, adding very little to the plot. This show could easily have 6 episodes, and that would improve a lot its entertaining value.\\'] [\"Quickly became my favorite show of all time. Honestly, I found it extraordinary. One of the very few times I\\'ve found a show worthy of all the hype. From the cinematography to the concept and everything in between. BUT PLEASE WATCH IT WITH SUBTITLES! It makes a huge difference. I watched it dubbed the second time amd it takes so much away.\"] [\"Very entertaining and high in production quality, but it suffered from some predictable writing and over the top acting issues. It was obvious from the get go who was going to win and last the longest because those were characters that received the most development. However, some of the plot twists worked, including the one at the end. Most episodes were well paced and a pleasure to watch thanks to lots of brutal action and decent dialogue, but the episode when everybody left could have been better. I\\'ll also say that the red hair ending and not getting on the plane was a bit weird, and it was disappointing not hearing anything more about the police officer considering how OP he was earlier on. Several characters were overdone acting and dialogue wise, like the woman who struggled to find a team and the main character in places. However, there was a good mix of characters, the acting was generally impressive, and the extras did a good job. Then the cinematography, sets/props/costumes, visual effects, editing, and soundtrack were all excellent for a TV show.\"] [\"This show was terrible. Don\\'t waste your time.\"] [\\'Believe the hype. Truly awesome TV.\\'] [\\'Boring and predictable\\'] [\\'let s start saying that eastern culture is completely different from the western..said that i don t understand how this show is popular in europe, us... this is just the proof that people follow what is popular. many asian might find this serie amazing but from a western guy point of view i have to say: - acting was terrible, a lot of overreaction for nothing. read that dubbing was bad. not at all, that s how asians talk and behave. if you didn t like the dubbing is because you don t like the style, as different from your culture. - everything in the movie was very predictable (at least untill episode 7, then i stopped watching). - extremely forced and pointless emotional scene, build up on hypocrisy and very obvious cliches. the idea itself was nothing new but good, the rest rubbish. i could like it if i was asian or maybe 11 years old (without splatter scene)\\'] [\"This show is very overrated and over-hyped. It\\'s a unique concept but it feels very unoriginal. With all that said it was very entertaining show that keeps the viewers engaged throughout most of it. It\\'s very detailed and one of my favorite details is the main characters number. With his number in the game being 456 it was a constant reminder of how many other players there were. Overall it\\'s worth a watch, but goes over the top in the genre every once in a while.\"] [\"I don\\'t honestly understand the plot line or attraction to this show.\"] [\"I don\\'t know how anyone could not like this show? I\\'m looking forward to Netflix\\'s future foreign offerings!\"] [\\'Finally finished. The writing was fairly obvious and very heavy handed, but overall it was entertaining.\\'] [\"This was one of those shows where once it hooks you, you\\'re along for the ride. And what a great ride it was.\"] [\\'Three stars for a great first few episodes, -2 Star for not holding the quality till the end\\'] [\\'absolute loved this series! hope theres a season 2!\\'] [\"It\\'s good. It\\'s not as big as the hype.\"] [\"It\\'s not an original plot, but it\\'s well written. Amazing characters, the show made you worry about them.\"] [\\'Ok, it\\\\\\'s rather fun but also grossly overrated. Something is lacking here: 1/ we\\\\\\'re used to \"torture porn for the entertainment of rich people\". So no surprise here. 2/ the motivation of the \"puppet master\" is ridiculous and doesn\\\\\\'t make sense from a psychological point of view... So eventually, if the show is entertaining, and an easy critics of our capitalist system, it doesn\\\\\\'t really quench the thirst it gives you in the first place.\\'] [\"I watched it till the end, but mainly out of curiosity. The concept is interesting but predictable, the acting is bad, but the dynamics and the filming are good. It gives a perspective of a world gone mad, with many hopeless indebted poor being the willing participants in a capitalist game. Despite the heavy theme, there is not much depth in the fim makers\\' analysis of exploitation, but it\\'s rather an excuse for violent entertainment.\"] [\\'This is one of the best things I have seen in a while it has a simple but interesting story line and has some emotional parts in this is a must see\\'] [\"I loved the character development and the sets were great. But I felt like the last episode was kind of boring and the ending didn\\'t make much sense\"] [\"I didn\\'t like the series. It doesn\\'t make any sense. I would rather see a series with 20 or 30 seasons about the life of José Castelo Branco. Too ridiculous series, I don\\'t understand how people like this dump!\"] [\"Absolutely incredible. I watched the dubbed version, and decided to rewatch the entire series in its original language with English subs. If you\\'re not into gore, blood, or violence, it\\'s definitely NOT for you.\"] [\"It\\'s fine. Worth your time.\"] [\\'legit emotional rollercoaster. laughed and cried. a must see!\\'] [\\'This is an amazing Korean drama! This drama really show the true colors when one is desperate for money.\\'] [\"It\\'s good but too much character development that wasn\\'t needed. Should have been ½ hour episodes instead of the hour long ones that most of them were\"] [\"I\\'m sorry but super overrated.\"] [\\'Aside from the politics, great watch! The originality of the sets, visuals and characters is entertaining and binge-worthy. Maybe a little predictable for those of us who have watched so many movies but recommended nevertheless.\\'] [\\'Absolutely brilliant. Great writing, every damn actor did a great job. The English dub is kind of charming, it\\\\\\'s funny at times but I came to think of those voices as his or her\\\\\\'s character\\\\\\'s voice. This is not some Korean version of \"Hunger Games\". I found this infinitely more interesting and entertaining than \"Hunger Games\". It really is a must see.\\'] [\"It\\'s good, but not THAT good to justify all the hype.\"] [\\'Awesome! bingwatched\\'] [\"Honestly, I didn\\'t know what to expect from this show. Things got fricken deep though! I almost cried watching Ali die. He was my favorite character immediately! This show has interesting story telling to keep viewers engaged, characters to love and characters to hate, tear jerking moments, character development, and deep themes. Not for the faint of heart, but still a great show!\"]'"

(random note: the scenes with english speaking foreigners were hilarious. the writing was mostly ok, but it didn\\'t come off as entirely natural. and combined with not-stellar acting it felt odd. i guess like asian scenes feel in western movies maybe.)\"] [\"yeah. worth the hype. i wasn\\'t wowed by the first episode of this drama, nor entirely enchanted by the second. but by the end of the second episode i thought... dang, okay, fine, i guess i want to keep watching. and i\\'m glad i did. the most thrilling and emotional parts of this show took place within the game itself. the games are simple children\\'s games, but are games that don\\'t necessarily require skill. most of the time, it\\'s luck; which number you drew, which shape you got, that sort of thing. the game purports to be \\'fair\\', but it\\'s only fair in the way that real life is fair. you\\'re stuck with the cards you\\'ve been given. the poor characters take part in the game because the real world is so terrible for them that the game is the best alternative they\\'ve got. sadly, some even think they can win, despite (as we\\'ve discussed) the games being largely luck-based. the characters are mostly pretty decent in this. the main character, gi hoon, is initially kind of a piece of trash, but you realize that he\\'s a gambling addict, and this leads to him hurting the people he loves. he\\'s not an inherently bad person who wants to hurt others, and you see that come out in the game, where he\\'s one of the kinder people there. the rest of the cast are also great, not a weak performance in sight. i\\'d say the cop\\'s plotline and character are mildly confusing and vague and you\\'re just not that emotionally invested in it compared to everyone else. the show continues to get better and better as the games keep going and people die.\\\\npeople die in very emotionally impacting ways, and i think they did all the character deaths very well. they often feel different too; whether it\\'s because it was accidental, somebody cheated so they lost, or just bad luck. and the deaths can weirdly almost feel like a part of their character arcs. i don\\'t know how the writers pulled it off but they did it well. tl;dr it\\'s really worth watching because it\\'s not just trashy fun, it has so much to say about the unfairness of the systems in this world that keep poor people down. i\\'m not sure i\\'d rewatch it because it\\'s so emotionally overwhelming at times but it is super good.\"] [\"average for it\\'s genre.  don\\'t get me wrong, this is a pretty decent show. but at the same time the ending didn\\'t satisfied me at all. it ended like this in order to have more seasons ofc but idk... for me it lacked smt. survival movies or tv shows are never a concept i find revolutionary, so i think it\\'s pretty funny how of all the kdramas out there, this one is the most watched on netflix. not only that but it\\'s the top2 most watched shows on netlix of all time. i understand everything and all that, but if i ever survived such a crazy hell i would either end up killing myself regardless or just really living and doing everything i\\'ve ever wanted. might as well... what\\'s the worst that can happen?\"] [\\'i watched this on the spur of the moment after having 0 intention of watching it previously, because tbh how many times have manga/anime fans seen this survival game concept? growing up with japanese entertainment, nothing about this show was new at all, but i still loved it. i suppose for westerners it might be new, but for me the shock factors or disturbing qualities didn\\\\\\'t stand out from originality but from the pure execution. i could say the majority of the plot turns were predictable as well but the pacing and performances were so good, that it kept me on the edge of my seat. the violence/gore wasn\\\\\\'t emotionally or mentally straining and was easy to get to used to after the initial shocks of the first two episodes. i loved the detective. passionately :d and not just because that man is incredibly fine, but his character addition really added to the quick pacing of the show, mixing in another storyline so as to almost give us a breather from the dirty inhumane warehouse feeling the other characters endured. i believe that the alternations of character/story focuses was what was really done well because it always kept you rolling and focused. a \"next, next, next action\" experience. the only reason i\\\\\\'m not giving it a 10 is because i really felt that the ending of some characters was rushed. episode 8-9 definitely lacked the full emotional appeal of loss for me and i was mildly disappointed but i understand there was a time crunch. i\\\\\\'ve never stayed up all night to watch a show before, but i did for squid game. i was absolutely groggy the next day but it was worth it. i\\\\\\'m currently rewatching it with my mom, and it is still an incredibly crisp viewing. the camerawork and colors were executed very, very well and i look forward to watching hwang dong hyuk\\\\\\'s other works. the \"novelty\" of squid game that\\\\\\'s all over media is 100% western hype in my opinion, but tbh with how well done this show was, it probably deserves it.\\'] [\"i wasn\\'t sure at first that this would be for me, i\\'m usually more of a romance based story lover, but this really surprised me. squid game has no romance, and i wasn\\'t bothered in the least about it. i was just an interesting story with morally grey compelling characters. i\\'m a bit confused about the ending. i\\'m not sure if they did it that way so that there could possibly be another season or just to make the viewer think? but overall, this kept me very engaged and i really liked it a lot! if the creators were to do another show set in this world, i would love to see more about how it started, how the workers are chosen and just more about the frontman. the frontman had the potential to be a really interesting character, the story just wasn\\'t focusing on him. i just want to know why he chose to join the game maybe even (spoilers) see what his original game was like and ultimately led him to abandon his family and become a major part of the game.\"] [\"a brilliant show fully worth watching. this is a show that is simultaneously brutal and beautiful in its depiction and execution. it\\'s a fantastic metaphor for capitalism and the illusion of autonomy, the compulsion to survive that drives the poorest when their supposed freedoms and choices are constrained by a need to survive. anyone could have left the game but out in the real world, the pressures would not let them. so they stayed and played.  i thought gi-hun was a weak and unsympathetic character, i didn\\'t like the actor\\'s constipated expressions at everything and i thought the support cast was better in terms of sympathetic characters and acting. the plot itself was formulaic but still great. lot of the deaths were foreshadowed but that often made the prelude thick with emotional suspense and a desperation to be proven wrong. the games were brutal and i thought in particular that episodes 4 and 7 were masterful. again, i felt let down by the main character and i also found everything on the side with the undercover policeman to be an unnecessary addition which could instead have been devoted to fleshing out the back stories of some of the other characters. i found the north korean defector (sorry i can\\'t remember her name) the most interesting whilst ali and the old man were the most endearing. this show really though could only be endured if you hated the characters. as soon as you began liking someone, they were bound to die.\"] [\"copied storyline with a weird ending and way too much blood. i watched this, because everyone keeeps talking about this series.postitive points: very good production, high quality. the actors gave a great performance. really can\\'t say anything bad about that! negative points: the whole story is just.... well it reminds me a lot of alice in borderland. expect that alice in borderland was a lot better in my opinion. the ending of squid game is kinda predictable and not satisfying at all. there isn\\'t really a happy ending for anyone. tbh i don\\'t get the hype. there are way better korean/ asian series out there. still, i think it\\'s cool that people start recognizing korean / asian series/ movies more :) if you like blood, gore and mind f*ck this series is for you, if you don\\'t, better watch something else.\"] [\\'squid game is one of the most exciting series to hit netflix in some time. it mashes up the carefree, idyllic days of childhood with the brutal realism of adulthood as it forces everyday people to compete in life or death matches in a bid to potentially wipe out their debts. equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing, it’s a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer. it’s one of the most unique things you’ll watch this year -- and maybe ever.\\'] [\\'show was lame, very weirdly paced and slow. it wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee. dont follow the hype either. idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there. alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense. you dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show. this show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as br. skip this or watch if your bored.\\'] [\"the fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. so much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that i hardly know where to start. but i\\'ll try. the purely cinematic criticism first: the character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. the character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. the supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. the cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. the music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. they have no influence on the film. the script has as many gaps as a swiss cheese and storylines go untold. the actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. they often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. the producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath interested in topics. instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. the last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. a game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. artistic? love for the medium of film? or an affection for pop culture? none of it. i have a hard time expressing how much i hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. our world, like ancient rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. have fun and welcome to the squid games. i\\'m out.\"] [\"starts off pretty well in the first episode. then it\\'s just downhill and pointless. the ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crap it turns out everything is dread, nothing has any meaning, and no one gets happy for anything. doom, gloom and bad acting is all you get.\"] [\"after now over 2000 unhelpfuls. here we go again. guys i don\\'t know what to say. squid game is not a good show. it\\'s garbage. i hope there won\\'t be a season 2, a spin off or a movie.\"] [\"watch the first episode if you can\\'t resist the marketing hype. you\\'ll see it\\'s a 3/4. but since these few points - due to the fresh storyline - are undeserved (it\\'s heavily inspired by the manga-anime kaiji, and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies), i\\'ll give it a 1. abysmal overacting, puppet characters, unrealistic and unrefined stuff. even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it\\'s trash.\"] [\"sadly and stupidly i watched every episode.  easily predictable on what happens and who\\'s who. the acting is woeful with even worse dubbing. if i can remember who recommended this to me, i\\'d throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting 9 hours of my life on utter dross. it\\'s not unique it\\'s not different. it\\'s all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surprise. if i can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done. \"] [\"could not relate to the story or any of the characters. just didn\\'t even care who lives, who dies. loopholes in the story galore. unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. in the end was like *yawn* whatever. no issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. this felt like it is riding on the wave movies like parasite created for korean cinema/tv. bloated overhyped nonsense at best. give it a skip and save your time.\"] [\\'could barely get through the first 30 mins of this. extremely boring, cheesy, unstimulating,... i kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on... a lot of over acting. i do not understand what the hype is all about.\\'] [\"this is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games. don\\'t want just waste of time.\"] [\"only a sociopath will like watching something like this. the show has very negative energy and it affects the audience. if you don\\'t realise that i\\'m sorry for you. i love thrillers and horror movies if they have a point in them. this is too much because there are literally so many people living in debt especially now during covid and the suicide rates have skyrocketed because of it. this is not funny, nor interesting, nor enjoyable to watch!\"] [\\'therefore i vote it in the gutter, because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it.\\'] [\"the talk and reviews have me bewildered, i\\'m only up to ep3 but am struggling after about 5 attempts to start bingeing. i find it boring and really childish, with pretty ordinary acting. the set design, art direction and general production values are very 1970\\'s. two more attempts then i\\'ll give up.\"] [\"it\\'s really not that good, highly predictable and the ending was terrible. i will say though, the main character and his acting wasn\\'t too bad, enjoyed watching him, but other than that, it\\'s a waste of time. anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series.\"] [\"let me preface: no, i am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. i have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while i thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, i can\\'t wrap my head around the hype. many people bring up how it is similar to x game, book, movie, etc. so i\\'m thinking netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it\\'s new or innovating. complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. it is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. also annoying is, yes, the vips act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there\\'s only one winner. in summary, was it good? depends on personal taste. was it genius, unique, or without flaws? absolutely not. i didn\\'t enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. i\\'d suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be.\"] [\\'first off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in takashi miikes \"kamisama no iu tôri.\" it almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.  second: i mostly have experience with south korean horror movies and i\\\\\\'ve always thought that south korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted japanese and chinese, but the acting in squid game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. it\\\\\\'s hard to connect with the story and the actors when they\\\\\\'re expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. this might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.\\'] [\\'the show was decent, worth watching but not as great as some are saying. took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing. get ready for season 2.\\'] [\"you know, not that bad considering overhype. ephemera, no more, but has a good picture, music and let\\'s say not so banal development of events( of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer, but for most series and viewers), let\\'s say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement (usually it is so). strongest side of this series is an acting, it is really solid. i think, considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as 1.\"] [\\'a hype is a hype is a hype... and our actual societys\\\\\\' zeitgeist. the series is far away from the mentioned \"masterpiece\". its starts very good, the first 3 parts are very enjoyable, but then it goes down quite quickly. everything is far too obvious, from the beginning everything is so clear, not one single surprise to the end, and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline, the bad dialogues and the overacting. furthermore full of plotholes, another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes. all in all nothing special.\\'] [\"how is this currently on a score of 8.2? the lead character was so annoying in the first 30 minutes that i switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through. it\\'s not a patch on either battle royale or the american version of that, hunger games. it drags on and on and on, and the ending is just flat. watch it if you must because of the binge/hype value, but it has little to offer any serious film buff.\"] [\\'good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated.\\'] [\\'...but then i saw the american actors that play a role and i knew that all the acting was really bad. starts off shocking and kinda intriguing and fades into being dumb and boring. had a hard time paying attention by the end.\\'] [\\'good theme, but story developed in a bad way. poor direction idle for 2hr movie release than that of an 9episode series.\\'] [\\'i loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe.\\'] [\\'a great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil american). they must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. like the sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. number six was the best for me. the sets are wes anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. the lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. the violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. the final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall i was highly entertained.\\'] [\\'i genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. a true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. when the carnage is occurring it\\\\\\'s nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the \"kill game\" genre that seems to always be elevated by korean talent behind and in front of the camera.\\'] [\\'this is an entertaining series from south korea that embodies elements of korean soap opera, chinese operatic acting and japanese theater. it uses classical chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting. it uses \"hunger games\" as it\\\\\\'s base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. the story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. it then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. it is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven have to agree with the other comments about the group of \"actors\" playing the vips. they obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! enjoyable for what it\\\\\\'s meant to be!\\'] [\\'a tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses. combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to.\\'] [\\'for those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. basically, the series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you\\\\\\'ll definitely notice and say when you\\\\\\'re watching \"that character is me!\".  it is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. the same money that come from the blood and sweat of others. the capitalist system claims that there is equity and justice in the distribution of the wealth. and this is far from the truth. as for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. that they only find pleasure in people suffer.\\'] [\\'when he finally wins some money...only to lose it 3 seconds later, i turned it off and didnt come back for a while. but eventually i did and it is pretty good. of course it drags 30 minute episodes into 1 hour long episodes..but its still good. both twists were so predictable. the police brother and the old man were so obvious...and what is the message of the show...being rich is just awful...lol korea must have lots of poor people.\\'] [\\'squid game is a great tv show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money. the tv show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money. i enjoyed the tv show: it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes. some mysteries also and some big revelations. i enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch. i will recommend anyone to watch this tv show. it was quite good.\\'] [\\'perfect to binge watching, this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted, twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments. while not really perfect, this is a perfectly fine netflix entertainment. totally recommended!\\'] [\"its different but the same basically a different take on the violent game shows were nobody really wins. episode 6 was the best episode. if there\\'s a season two it needs to be the revenge.\"] [\"if you enjoy korean movies then this is a must see. has become a real hit, cool idea, interesting games and drama. plenty of story to continue more seasons , i\\'ve got final 2 eps left but have really enjoyed up to this point.\"] [\\'typical korean ott actionand some real life back stories thrown in for good measure. was good to see a non korean, ali abdul, in this. thoroughly entertaining and a great distraction from all the madness in the world.\\'] [\\'this tv show is very good to me, something different from what we are used to watch, for me is very original.\\'] [\"this is the first korean drama i\\'ve watched while i was absolutely blown away. there were a couple of moments where i thought the story dragged a little, however it was all added for tension i\\'m sure. it was absolutely stunning to look at and really well done. i can\\'t wait to see what happens in the next series.\"] [\\'great show. korean drama that is perceivable for n. american audience. similar story attempts have been made in the past, but this one has a great blend of drama with a little unpleasantries.\\'] [\"wow!! no show has ever stressed me out as much as this one. it was seriously insane and crazy and hilarious all at once. kept me on the edge of my seat that\\'s for sure. it had me laughing and crying and terrified.\"] [\\'well directed, pretty good writing, uneven acting (partly over the top theatrical, partly just as it should be), well produced and shot, keeps viewers\\\\\\' attention, slightly predictable at moments (and in general), masterfully edited and with an appropriate music score. as the tile says: good watch (but only once, since then you\\\\\\'ll know \"the secret\", and the mystery will be gone forever).\\'] [\\'really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the vip stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. has great production values and acting. episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how season 2 will turn out.\\'] [\\'this was a generally ok show. very typical of an anime series. just another game show game where people fight it out to the death. some sets were stupid like the arcade machines that could wipe surveillance footage of people in a hallway magically with one random arcade button. none of that \"typey typey break the code and delete\".. just.. \"okay this button should probably be pre-programed to erase evidence of stuff...  ended up not even being a part of the end story plot. yo.. hello. anyone listening? no answers on the harvest body parts?? just the \"you can sell them or eat them, i don\\\\\\'t care but....\" part. then boom that entire plot is gone. seriously, i have picked apart this entire series and it\\\\\\'s just absolutely a typical live action anime, bad dub and all. i can\\\\\\'t tell if the actors sucked of if it was the voice over actors ... first episodes drew me in as something new but series left me feeling like i just watched another dumb anime, not an exciting drama with original characters. this show revealed a lot to me about how people stereotype the rest of the world based on racist stereotypes... is all media propaganda in some way or another?\\'] [\\'in the first 2 episodes, there was a sense of potential in the series but as it progresses, it felt like the scriptwriters are just adding cliches. not something i would expect from a korean drama. i expected it to be unique, not your usual survival-themed series, and you know the type that gets you thinking. everything about this screams american: storyline, predictability, acting, character development? (if there is any), and concept. it was lackluster and i honestly was cringing just wishing it to be over. i predicted almost everything except gong yoo’s role. the casts are great! star-studded even. but when those foreigners started acting, i had the hardest cringe of my life. they made a bad series even worse. i’m not ecstatic for a season 2 but i can already smell a possible storyline. not to mention lee byung-hun’s brother who i presumed to be alive because the gunshot is not fatal. i’ll give season 2 the benefit of the doubt but i’m really sorry coz this season is not worth my time.\\'] [\\'probably the most horrible acting i have ever! seen. the writers of this probably wear goat masks and blow each-other just like in the show. the storyline is so bad that i think netflix should start recruiting people in grade 3. if they don’t already. by the way that idea is patent pending lol. i think i will run a series where netflix employees are given certain castings then imprisoned to play games to the death. that is yet another great idea just within a review! cheers.\\'] [\\'compelling, visually intriguing, exciting, fast paced and innovative. it has all the right credentials, apart from the inane and unnecessary violence. i don’t give a jot for all the reviews that say it’s a clever commentary on society today. it is not. it is a show that does nothing other than glorify death for no reason whatsoever. any clever commentary could have been communicated without the need for death. and worse the volume of people who are raving about it. what does that say about our society? that so many are utterly unaffected by such gratuitous murder - that it’s justifiable? that their lives were of no value and expendable just because they were financially ruined? i didn’t get what moral this show was trying to teach me, but surely there has to be some deeper truth to justify such macabre storytelling. i watched one episode and that was enough. shame on you netflix for peddling such brutality.\\'] [\\'one of the worst shows of the genre. the one star given is for aesthetics, but other than that the series delivers nothing more than a combination of ideas from other survival game dramas and movies. besides the dramatic acting approach and impressive setting, the series failed to deliver its messaging despite wanting to appear deep and introspective. mildly annoyed by how many perceive this show to be more clever and introspective than it is.  many aspects are not explained well, or there’s really no meaning behind them at all.\\'] [\\'not a fan of whole killing spree but the series was off to a good start with recruiting and with games. but major bummer was the end. wth was that ending? throughout the series it was conveyed to the audience the 456 is a good man except in marble game and then he just idling with his life for one whole year without fulfilling the promises he made for the last 2 dying ones in the game when he had billions in his account. ending was pathetic to the point make me feel it was such a waste of time watching all that. there are unwanted scenarios in the series.\\'] [\\'the idea of story is genius, smart but sorry to say i dont like this film because to many provide sadistic, violence, inhuman. many students of my country talking and interesting about this movie although their age are  not enough and not allowed to see the movie. hope if this film will be released in 2 series...could you please make it with softly?  because your movie inspired many people..thank you and success for your team\\'] [\\'i left the first episode with pain in my chest…literally. this show is not smart, not entertaining and an unfortunate representation of what we are expected to believe: that money and hate over-rule humanity. netflix does not fail in releasing one show after the other that depict the big lie; that humanity knows nothing but hate, jealousy, betrayal, anger and filth. the truth is that humanity is capable of so much love, but we will never see that on yet another mass propaganda channel. please spend your time spreading the right messages, serving the world to be a better place and indulging in good, smart and uplifting content…not this.\\'] [\"the filming and pace is okay, but most characters are inconsequential and lackluster. there\\'s no real meaningful character development in this series. many promising characters starting out, but most ended up being just plot devices to get the story moving. virtually nothing will change if you swap some of the main characters out. games are also extremely bland compared to similar pieces like liar game or alice in borderland. considering there are (without giving spoilers) quite a few a games and they take up significant amount of the screen time, the fact that there are almost no clever design to these games and how they play out is very disappointing. it is an okay series as pastime. however if you compare it to any serious predecessor in the genre, this one is quite pale in comparison especially at its core.\"] [\"if you like watching people get killed while playing children games for money at any cost to win or gamble w/their life to get out of a financial  crisis. then this is your  netflix tv series movie.  i found it to be downright disturbing considering the world we live in today it definitely fits into the grand scheme of things during this pandemic. what people will do for money especially when you are forced to make that decision. it shows who has morals or not.  in conclusion, definitely not my cup of tea but maybe someone else\\'s flavor.\"] [\\'but the story suffers in the ending. the reaction of the protagonist became abnormal to the point of him trying to kill a dying man on his deathbed (can he be a little compassionate like when he wanted to just stop the last game because he suddenly grew a conscience), talking slowly when he saw his mother lying on the floor (the normal reaction is to call for help immediately), and him living like a beggar for a year, not using his winnings. the ending would have been better when the last part was the scene from the atm, showing the whooping amount he earned.\\'] [\\'the main character is boring and relies on luck too much. the sets are creative but the characters have such basic and cookie cutter arcs. not to mention the parts with the doctor player were extremely boring, and many unnecessary scenes were added. the reveal at the end and the purpose of the squid game didn’t really have an effect. for me, it led to sort of a “so what” conclusion. a good show to kill time if you’ve got not much else to watch.\\'] [\"made it through most of episode 2 before bailing.  no sympathy for self-inflicted losers sob stories, and no interest in seeing the suffering they cause others.  the girl or the mother were the only redeeming characters, and watching them suffer offers no joy.  don\\'t care what happens to deranged gamblers, so why watch?  the acting is melodramatic caricatures, more cartoonish than appealing, and the concept is just absurd. the production values are high so 2 stars for that. just personal opinion.\"] [\\'the whole drama is vibrant, all actors performance is awesome, bringing the drama to a different level.\\'] [\\'its a good show but very sexist towards women. it showing young kids that men are stronger than women its disgusting. it will make girls feel like they cant grow up to stand up for themselves. they make women seem less than. overall should empower women more as their are a lot of women out their who work their but off to fight and be strong!! overall good show also is this off how korea treats those who are poor? should have made women to be seen as more confident and stronger\\'] [\"the premise itself is good and the first few episodes are well-executed, but there\\'s a bit of a cultural clash regarding some of the tropes and the characters\\' mindsets when presented to a western audience. egalitarianism between the sexes isn\\'t as progressed in korea, so the repeated emphasis on the female players being weaker, undesirable teammates was pretty grating.\"] [\\'the ending was very disappointing, after such a large amount of character development i expected better. you do get to grow fond of characters, and there are many anticipated plot twists. some points in the storyline seemed like they were tied off hastily, somethings were left with lackluster if any answers. not sure if it’s a ploy to lead up to a second season, but i found myself literally angry at the end. for a character’s entire motive to just be abandoned at the last minute is just irritating. redemption was available many times over for the main character, just to be fumbled and squandered. production was gorgeous though. the vips would be more tolerable without any lines, as they remained anonymous and got away ultimately nothing would have been missed.\\'] [\"i binged it the entire day, and it was good but i didn\\'t like the ending too, but the acting was amazing plus the set\"] [\\'it’s wacky… it’s sappy… it goes from slapstick zany to blood splattering gruesome… and emotionally fluctuates with really extreme characters/situations. it’s kind of all over the place. in my opinion, it was ok. there were some characterizations and stereotypes that i found slightly offensive, and there were some elements that were so illogical, it completely pulled my focus out of the main actions. when a group of certain special people arrive, i think it gets kind of dumb. the colors and aesthetics of the costume/set design are stunning, but i think some of the masks are just way over the top.  i love mask. i’ve made masks, and often wear large obnoxious masks at halloween parties. i know how cumbersome and uncomfortable they can get. there’s no way some of the characters in the show would be wearing those gaudy, hot, heavy masks all the time. that said, the characters are mostly engaging, and story is bizarre enough to keep one watching till the end.\\'] [\\'a lot of people that is new to the genre might find this show entertaining. personally, i enjoyed some parts of this show. but most of the time,  i find myself questioning the simplicity of the games itself, the shallow plotline, building up moral compasses that leads to nowhere, and disappointing character developments (yeah i am talking about the main character: he is as selfish as he was during the first episode and the last episode).\\'] [\\'this is the first time i am putting my review for any tv series. squid game is definitely an engaging and intriguing series and a binge watch for all. the twist in the end was great, as i never saw that coming and the ending of the first season tells us that a second season is om its way soon.\\'] [\\'this series is very interesting and definitely keeps you wanting to watch more just because the events happening in the show. but honestly i had to watch the show in incriminates because if i watched too much at once i’d get sick to my stomach because this show is pretty gruesome. it shows pretty rough things and honestly makes you think how it’s rated #1 on netflix right now. personally i think no one under the age 15/16 should watch this series because of the events that happen. anyone with trauma i don’t think should watch this either because of the scenes. i don’t want to ruin anything for anyone who reads this but warning to all its gruesome.\\'] [\"i would like to write an honest review. i\\'m not going to write what people seeing on internet about show. truth is, it was a good series no doubt. acting skills are so damn good. but, it obviously bored you in last 2 episodes. where there is need of adreline rush obviously. episode 3, 4, 5,6 are best in the entire series. i would like to suggest you people, do not follow the hype created about the show on social network media. there are other series and movie better than that, but didn\\'t get praised. all those hype they had created on social media is paid. n one mormost important thing, i fall sleep watching this show twice. now you can conclude on your own.\"] [\\'the first few episodes were captivating, mostly for the shock factor. but unfortunately i think it fell off entirely after episode six (which is meant to be very sad, but how can we feel that sad for anyone when we have become so desensitised to people dying already?). there were a few \"should we just skip?\" moments in the last two episodes due to the drag. after finishing the show i felt a little unsatisfied. overall it was a well produced show and showcased some brilliant acting; even if the story falls off at the end. still worth a watch.\\'] [\"the only negative point of this series is it\\'s too slow plus many of the scenes are streched very unnecessarily. for eg:- in last episode, there\\'s a two way communication and it is been streched continuously for half and hours and it\\'s damn boring. i don\\'t know what the makers were thinking, they might have thought that yes we\\'re creating great suspense but no you\\'re making the audience feel bore. the positive things are the sets and performance. every actor just killed it in their role. also the sets were designed very beautifully for the task.\"] [\"the show has some really brilliant scenes but in the end comes to a predictable and tame ending. the ending could\\'ve been so much more. i would say a good watch for creative and concept value. as well as the performances by the entire cast.\"] [\"not a bad series but highly overated in my opinion. the story is old but the acting is superb. cruelty is similar to saw and tarantino. a lot of moral dilemmas arise as the show progresses. the uniforms and the playground songs are well placed. not recommended for anyone under 18. it can be rough for audiences that don\\'t like death games movies\"] [\"it is disturbing, gross and insane. the show isn\\'t binge worthy if you\\'re easily triggered by violence. deep down it is a lesson how nostalgia & the urge to make money can actually kill you.\"] [\"the series had a motive of showing the people that they are actually different kinds of animals in the world. but there is a difference animals don\\'t think , alternatively humans do. they are very ugly inside. actually we don\\'t have feelings at all, we use it for our own advantage. humans always  consider for their selves  first  and then their loved ones. this series will give you how people are seen in different situations when they are placed. money will buy you everything but we , humans are never ever satisfied.\"] [\\'fantastic show to begin with - really hooks you in and it becomes essential to watch till the end. as the show progresses however it does begin to get somewhat tiresome, cliché and there are some really drawn out episodes towards the end that drag with some questionable writing.\\'] [\\'my oh my goodness this season excited me and to be brutally honest first episode i didn’t have much clue to what it was about, i hadn’t even watched a trailer for it and to be honest i don’t really like the name of the show squid game. but the a old saying in life don’t judge a book by its cover and i guess that old saying rings true here.\\'] [\\'ending was dragged out a bit and although they have made it very suggestive of a possible season 2, the fact it was dragged out this way has definitely decreased the ending scenes quality significantly, however if it had not done this i could not see this advancing into a second season smoothly if at all.\\'] [\\'absolutely amazing show. i have never left a review on any show i’ve ever watched in my entire life but i recommend this show to everyone. the plot is not predictable which i find very intriguing. kudos to the creators because this show, it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society. not only does this show keep you hooked, but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole. with all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one i’ve seen to date. there are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all i highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you. it’s much needed perspective growth that more people should delve into.\\'] [\"this show is really amazing, you can feel each characters emotions and feeling well. the first half of this show make you feel various kind of feelings just like roller coaster is going on and then in the half, its become heavy and tense. last of the episodes are really heart wrenching  i mean i can\\'t hold my tears it was to heavy.. well this show won\\'t let you down in any aspects.\"] [\\'i haven’t watch any type of production so damn moving emotionally. albeit this show is extremely emotionally and mentally draining, it truly is personally moving and simply amazing work done by the writer/creator, production staff, director and actors whom simply make this show one of the greatest film or movie i’ve ever laud witness to. the character building alone is that of legendary status while each of the main casts actors are so perfectly cast and act their roles in ways i didn’t expect. this isn’t just a korean hunger games by any means but more like a human case study on our nature and society as human beings. this is a must watch for all adults as i’m sure young people will love the violence and story but adults will immediately relate with this show on so many levels\\'] [\"i finished this series in 2 days! it keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you can\\'t stop watching!! one complaint i have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field  (*cough* clickbait *cough*) but squid game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective. the acting and character development is so good, you really feel for the characters which makes their demise that much more devastating. this show is a must watch!\"] [\"i binged this show and i loved it, everyone i recommended this show to loved it. great characters and a well-written story, that makes you want more. i\\'ve never left reviews before but squid game deserves it! the acting is amazing, even for the guards who you can\\'t see their faces but they still hold a lot of emotion. (spoilers) i loved rewatching it and finding all the hints i missed about the games on the wall, or player 001 not being scanned during red light green light. the characters were so well written and even relatable that it was truly sad to see them die. (spoilers over) i highly recommend watching this show for yourself, it\\'s truly amazing and grabs you from the start. it made number 1 on netflix so it clearly did something right!\"] [\"wow. what an awesome series. despite the fact that (possible spoiler alert if it is ?) it\\'s easy to predict who will win since whoever is considered the main character almost always outlasts everyone, everything else is just mind-blowingly well-done. you admire this show as an exquisite piece of art. the soundtrack is fantastic, really ominous and foreboding like the show. sets/props are actually inspired by real works of art and incorporate things from real life allowing scenes to stick in your mind. acting is top-notch, everyone plays their part to their character. story has a lot of depth too and little details that foreshadow events -- things you come to realize only after you\\'ve finished the show -- let\\'s you appreciate how much thought has gone into making this show. most importantly, it\\'s a story that\\'s resonating with a lot of people who are struggling to get by every day. even with people who are well-off but feel the intense pressures of being in a competitive society we live in today. it\\'s moving. it\\'s powerful. it\\'s beautiful. watch it.\"] [\\'squid game is neatly written, well-directed, and one of the most vibrant show that i have ever come across in recent times. the character development, storyline, and plot execution are jaw-dropping. it really pushes you to think out of the box and questions your personal belief of humanity, life, relationship, and most importantly, how far an individual is willing to go for money even though if it requires the harshest of sacrifices.\\'] [\"this is the definition of a binge-worthy show!! haven\\'t seen a drama for a while, the storys usually seem to get repetitive and quite predictable but not this one! apart from the fact that it was obvious the protagonist would survive since the story revolved around him, every episode was packed with twists at every turn, really had me on up my toes!! it was so refreshing to watch a such a clever and well-thought out drama with some very thought-provoking life lessons ! the cast, needless to say, made it all the more worth watching.. i am a korean drama addict but squid game really has the potential to get anyone hooked! its that good!\"] [\"i have never written a review for a show before, but this one was so good that i honestly just had to, especially since i finished the series in 2 days! unlike alice in borderland, which many claim to be similar to this show, squid game truly makes you feel connected to the characters, which ultimately makes their demise all the more heartbreaking. the show is not as gory as some japanese counterparts, but definitely does make you feel uneasy/unsettled. love how the show ties together children\\'s games and twists them into something far more sinister. i truly hope to see a season 2 soon!\"] [\"wow, i was truly blown away by this amazing series. every single thing about this show draws you in and it keeps you hooked. i stayed up way later then i should\\'ve when having to go to work the next day, just to keep watching. the acting couldn\\'t be better, the idea is similar to others, but this one is still so original at the same time. it had a little bit of every genre in this to where i know anyone would end up liking this series. i\\'ve really been enjoying a lot of the south korean series that netflix has been streaming lately. i hope they keep it up and i will be so upset if this doesn\\'t get a season 2!!\"] [\"i finished this series in just 1 day!

emotional at times. check it out!!\\'] [\"i watched episode 1 on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series, and they were absolutely right. i was captured right away. the series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing. beware, cause there is more than enough violence in the series, and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters, at the same time that you despise others. keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events. you probably won\\'t see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often. the best thing about this series is the acting. my mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances. there are true emmy or oscar level performances throughout the show. one of the best series i\\'ve watched in a long time.\"] [\\'i wanted to like this. i love asian film and tv from most of their countries, and this entry started interesting enough but even some of the initial elements forbode what my instincts told me would be a lame ending, thus maintaining the \"we don\\\\\\'t care what we put out\" tradition of crappy netflix fare. 9 hours to a horrible disappointing payoff. it started to go off the rails and become a self righteous preachy mess around episode 4. i won\\\\\\'t give away the ending but i warned you, though i\\\\\\'m sure the lemmings who follow anything will applaud it.\\'] [\\'bad acting and foolish composition. i just cannot grasp why people rate this over 5 points. really. if it dosent take more than something like this to get great rating, the quality perception has really deteriorated during the pandemic.\\'] [\"i seriously don\\'t know what the hype is all about. is it because people get killed while playing a game? is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey? because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better. to me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long.\"] [\"started well. but mid way through, it gets tired and feels sluggish. the games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc. the ending was horrible and vague.it shows that losers will be losers even after winning. just not relevant in today\\'s world.\"] [\\'nothing more than a korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc. terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes. probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy, anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time.\\'] [\\'this show has a great script, excellent actors, but fails to keep the viewers interested, because it is really slow. i often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer, adding very little to the plot. this show could easily have 6 episodes, and that would improve a lot its entertaining value.\\'] [\"quickly became my favorite show of all time. honestly, i found it extraordinary. one of the very few times i\\'ve found a show worthy of all the hype. from the cinematography to the concept and everything in between. but please watch it with subtitles! it makes a huge difference. i watched it dubbed the second time amd it takes so much away.\"] [\"very entertaining and high in production quality, but it suffered from some predictable writing and over the top acting issues. it was obvious from the get go who was going to win and last the longest because those were characters that received the most development. however, some of the plot twists worked, including the one at the end. most episodes were well paced and a pleasure to watch thanks to lots of brutal action and decent dialogue, but the episode when everybody left could have been better. i\\'ll also say that the red hair ending and not getting on the plane was a bit weird, and it was disappointing not hearing anything more about the police officer considering how op he was earlier on. several characters were overdone acting and dialogue wise, like the woman who struggled to find a team and the main character in places. however, there was a good mix of characters, the acting was generally impressive, and the extras did a good job. then the cinematography, sets/props/costumes, visual effects, editing, and soundtrack were all excellent for a tv show.\"] [\"this show was terrible. don\\'t waste your time.\"] [\\'believe the hype. truly awesome tv.\\'] [\\'boring and predictable\\'] [\\'let s start saying that eastern culture is completely different from the western..said that i don t understand how this show is popular in europe, us... this is just the proof that people follow what is popular. many asian might find this serie amazing but from a western guy point of view i have to say: - acting was terrible, a lot of overreaction for nothing. read that dubbing was bad. not at all, that s how asians talk and behave. if you didn t like the dubbing is because you don t like the style, as different from your culture. - everything in the movie was very predictable (at least untill episode 7, then i stopped watching). - extremely forced and pointless emotional scene, build up on hypocrisy and very obvious cliches. the idea itself was nothing new but good, the rest rubbish. i could like it if i was asian or maybe 11 years old (without splatter scene)\\'] [\"this show is very overrated and over-hyped. it\\'s a unique concept but it feels very unoriginal. with all that said it was very entertaining show that keeps the viewers engaged throughout most of it. it\\'s very detailed and one of my favorite details is the main characters number. with his number in the game being 456 it was a constant reminder of how many other players there were. overall it\\'s worth a watch, but goes over the top in the genre every once in a while.\"] [\"i don\\'t honestly understand the plot line or attraction to this show.\"] [\"i don\\'t know how anyone could not like this show? i\\'m looking forward to netflix\\'s future foreign offerings!\"] [\\'finally finished. the writing was fairly obvious and very heavy handed, but overall it was entertaining.\\'] [\"this was one of those shows where once it hooks you, you\\'re along for the ride. and what a great ride it was.\"] [\\'three stars for a great first few episodes, -2 star for not holding the quality till the end\\'] [\\'absolute loved this series!

(random note: the scenes with english speaking foreigners were hilarious. the writing was mostly ok, but it didn\\'t come off as entirely natural. and combined with not-stellar acting it felt odd. i guess like asian scenes feel in western movies maybe.)\"] [\"yeah. worth the hype. i wasn\\'t wowed by the first episode of this drama, nor entirely enchanted by the second. but by the end of the second episode i thought... dang, okay, fine, i guess i want to keep watching. and i\\'m glad i did. the most thrilling and emotional parts of this show took place within the game itself. the games are simple children\\'s games, but are games that don\\'t necessarily require skill. most of the time, it\\'s luck; which number you drew, which shape you got, that sort of thing. the game purports to be \\'fair\\', but it\\'s only fair in the way that real life is fair. you\\'re stuck with the cards you\\'ve been given. the poor characters take part in the game because the real world is so terrible for them that the game is the best alternative they\\'ve got. sadly, some even think they can win, despite (as we\\'ve discussed) the games being largely luck-based. the characters are mostly pretty decent in this. the main character, gi hoon, is initially kind of a piece of trash, but you realize that he\\'s a gambling addict, and this leads to him hurting the people he loves. he\\'s not an inherently bad person who wants to hurt others, and you see that come out in the game, where he\\'s one of the kinder people there. the rest of the cast are also great, not a weak performance in sight. i\\'d say the cop\\'s plotline and character are mildly confusing and vague and you\\'re just not that emotionally invested in it compared to everyone else. the show continues to get better and better as the games keep going and people die.\\\\npeople die in very emotionally impacting ways, and i think they did all the character deaths very well. they often feel different too; whether it\\'s because it was accidental, somebody cheated so they lost, or just bad luck. and the deaths can weirdly almost feel like a part of their character arcs. i don\\'t know how the writers pulled it off but they did it well. tl;dr it\\'s really worth watching because it\\'s not just trashy fun, it has so much to say about the unfairness of the systems in this world that keep poor people down. i\\'m not sure i\\'d rewatch it because it\\'s so emotionally overwhelming at times but it is super good.\"] [\"average for it\\'s genre.  don\\'t get me wrong, this is a pretty decent show. but at the same time the ending didn\\'t satisfied me at all. it ended like this in order to have more seasons ofc but idk... for me it lacked smt. survival movies or tv shows are never a concept i find revolutionary, so i think it\\'s pretty funny how of all the kdramas out there, this one is the most watched on netflix. not only that but it\\'s the top most watched shows on netlix of all time. i understand everything and all that, but if i ever survived such a crazy hell i would either end up killing myself regardless or just really living and doing everything i\\'ve ever wanted. might as well... what\\'s the worst that can happen?\"] [\\'i watched this on the spur of the moment after having  intention of watching it previously, because tbh how many times have manga/anime fans seen this survival game concept? growing up with japanese entertainment, nothing about this show was new at all, but i still loved it. i suppose for westerners it might be new, but for me the shock factors or disturbing qualities didn\\\\\\'t stand out from originality but from the pure execution. i could say the majority of the plot turns were predictable as well but the pacing and performances were so good, that it kept me on the edge of my seat. the violence/gore wasn\\\\\\'t emotionally or mentally straining and was easy to get to used to after the initial shocks of the first two episodes. i loved the detective. passionately :d and not just because that man is incredibly fine, but his character addition really added to the quick pacing of the show, mixing in another storyline so as to almost give us a breather from the dirty inhumane warehouse feeling the other characters endured. i believe that the alternations of character/story focuses was what was really done well because it always kept you rolling and focused. a \"next, next, next action\" experience. the only reason i\\\\\\'m not giving it a  is because i really felt that the ending of some characters was rushed. episode - definitely lacked the full emotional appeal of loss for me and i was mildly disappointed but i understand there was a time crunch. i\\\\\\'ve never stayed up all night to watch a show before, but i did for squid game. i was absolutely groggy the next day but it was worth it. i\\\\\\'m currently rewatching it with my mom, and it is still an incredibly crisp viewing. the camerawork and colors were executed very, very well and i look forward to watching hwang dong hyuk\\\\\\'s other works. the \"novelty\" of squid game that\\\\\\'s all over media is % western hype in my opinion, but tbh with how well done this show was, it probably deserves it.\\'] [\"i wasn\\'t sure at first that this would be for me, i\\'m usually more of a romance based story lover, but this really surprised me. squid game has no romance, and i wasn\\'t bothered in the least about it. i was just an interesting story with morally grey compelling characters. i\\'m a bit confused about the ending. i\\'m not sure if they did it that way so that there could possibly be another season or just to make the viewer think? but overall, this kept me very engaged and i really liked it a lot! if the creators were to do another show set in this world, i would love to see more about how it started, how the workers are chosen and just more about the frontman. the frontman had the potential to be a really interesting character, the story just wasn\\'t focusing on him. i just want to know why he chose to join the game maybe even (spoilers) see what his original game was like and ultimately led him to abandon his family and become a major part of the game.\"] [\"a brilliant show fully worth watching. this is a show that is simultaneously brutal and beautiful in its depiction and execution. it\\'s a fantastic metaphor for capitalism and the illusion of autonomy, the compulsion to survive that drives the poorest when their supposed freedoms and choices are constrained by a need to survive. anyone could have left the game but out in the real world, the pressures would not let them. so they stayed and played.  i thought gi-hun was a weak and unsympathetic character, i didn\\'t like the actor\\'s constipated expressions at everything and i thought the support cast was better in terms of sympathetic characters and acting. the plot itself was formulaic but still great. lot of the deaths were foreshadowed but that often made the prelude thick with emotional suspense and a desperation to be proven wrong. the games were brutal and i thought in particular that episodes  and  were masterful. again, i felt let down by the main character and i also found everything on the side with the undercover policeman to be an unnecessary addition which could instead have been devoted to fleshing out the back stories of some of the other characters. i found the north korean defector (sorry i can\\'t remember her name) the most interesting whilst ali and the old man were the most endearing. this show really though could only be endured if you hated the characters. as soon as you began liking someone, they were bound to die.\"] [\"copied storyline with a weird ending and way too much blood. i watched this, because everyone keeeps talking about this series.postitive points: very good production, high quality. the actors gave a great performance. really can\\'t say anything bad about that! negative points: the whole story is just.... well it reminds me a lot of alice in borderland. expect that alice in borderland was a lot better in my opinion. the ending of squid game is kinda predictable and not satisfying at all. there isn\\'t really a happy ending for anyone. tbh i don\\'t get the hype. there are way better korean/ asian series out there. still, i think it\\'s cool that people start recognizing korean / asian series/ movies more :) if you like blood, gore and mind f*ck this series is for you, if you don\\'t, better watch something else.\"] [\\'squid game is one of the most exciting series to hit netflix in some time. it mashes up the carefree, idyllic days of childhood with the brutal realism of adulthood as it forces everyday people to compete in life or death matches in a bid to potentially wipe out their debts. equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing, it’s a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer. it’s one of the most unique things you’ll watch this year -- and maybe ever.\\'] [\\'show was lame, very weirdly paced and slow. it wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee. dont follow the hype either. idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there. alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense. you dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show. this show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as br. skip this or watch if your bored.\\'] [\"the fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the st century. so much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that i hardly know where to start. but i\\'ll try. the purely cinematic criticism first: the character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. the character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. the supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. the cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. the music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. they have no influence on the film. the script has as many gaps as a swiss cheese and storylines go untold. the actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. they often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. the producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath interested in topics. instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. the last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. a game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. artistic? love for the medium of film? or an affection for pop culture? none of it. i have a hard time expressing how much i hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. our world, like ancient rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. have fun and welcome to the squid games. i\\'m out.\"] [\"starts off pretty well in the first episode. then it\\'s just downhill and pointless. the ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crap it turns out everything is dread, nothing has any meaning, and no one gets happy for anything. doom, gloom and bad acting is all you get.\"] [\"after now over  unhelpfuls. here we go again. guys i don\\'t know what to say. squid game is not a good show. it\\'s garbage. i hope there won\\'t be a season , a spin off or a movie.\"] [\"watch the first episode if you can\\'t resist the marketing hype. you\\'ll see it\\'s a /. but since these few points - due to the fresh storyline - are undeserved (it\\'s heavily inspired by the manga-anime kaiji, and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies), i\\'ll give it a . abysmal overacting, puppet characters, unrealistic and unrefined stuff. even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it\\'s trash.\"] [\"sadly and stupidly i watched every episode.  easily predictable on what happens and who\\'s who. the acting is woeful with even worse dubbing. if i can remember who recommended this to me, i\\'d throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting  hours of my life on utter dross. it\\'s not unique it\\'s not different. it\\'s all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surprise. if i can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done. \"] [\"could not relate to the story or any of the characters. just didn\\'t even care who lives, who dies. loopholes in the story galore. unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. in the end was like *yawn* whatever. no issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. this felt like it is riding on the wave movies like parasite created for korean cinema/tv. bloated overhyped nonsense at best. give it a skip and save your time.\"] [\\'could barely get through the first  mins of this. extremely boring, cheesy, unstimulating,... i kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on... a lot of over acting. i do not understand what the hype is all about.\\'] [\"this is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games. don\\'t want just waste of time.\"] [\"only a sociopath will like watching something like this. the show has very negative energy and it affects the audience. if you don\\'t realise that i\\'m sorry for you. i love thrillers and horror movies if they have a point in them. this is too much because there are literally so many people living in debt especially now during covid and the suicide rates have skyrocketed because of it. this is not funny, nor interesting, nor enjoyable to watch!\"] [\\'therefore i vote it in the gutter, because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it.\\'] [\"the talk and reviews have me bewildered, i\\'m only up to ep but am struggling after about  attempts to start bingeing. i find it boring and really childish, with pretty ordinary acting. the set design, art direction and general production values are very \\'s. two more attempts then i\\'ll give up.\"] [\"it\\'s really not that good, highly predictable and the ending was terrible. i will say though, the main character and his acting wasn\\'t too bad, enjoyed watching him, but other than that, it\\'s a waste of time. anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series.\"] [\"let me preface: no, i am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. i have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while i thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, i can\\'t wrap my head around the hype. many people bring up how it is similar to x game, book, movie, etc. so i\\'m thinking netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it\\'s new or innovating. complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. it is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. also annoying is, yes, the vips act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there\\'s only one winner. in summary, was it good? depends on personal taste. was it genius, unique, or without flaws? absolutely not. i didn\\'t enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. i\\'d suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be.\"] [\\'first off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in takashi miikes \"kamisama no iu tôri.\" it almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.  second: i mostly have experience with south korean horror movies and i\\\\\\'ve always thought that south korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted japanese and chinese, but the acting in squid game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. it\\\\\\'s hard to connect with the story and the actors when they\\\\\\'re expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. this might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.\\'] [\\'the show was decent, worth watching but not as great as some are saying. took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing. get ready for season .\\'] [\"you know, not that bad considering overhype. ephemera, no more, but has a good picture, music and let\\'s say not so banal development of events( of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer, but for most series and viewers), let\\'s say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement (usually it is so). strongest side of this series is an acting, it is really solid. i think, considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as .\"] [\\'a hype is a hype is a hype... and our actual societys\\\\\\' zeitgeist. the series is far away from the mentioned \"masterpiece\". its starts very good, the first  parts are very enjoyable, but then it goes down quite quickly. everything is far too obvious, from the beginning everything is so clear, not one single surprise to the end, and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline, the bad dialogues and the overacting. furthermore full of plotholes, another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes. all in all nothing special.\\'] [\"how is this currently on a score of .? the lead character was so annoying in the first  minutes that i switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through. it\\'s not a patch on either battle royale or the american version of that, hunger games. it drags on and on and on, and the ending is just flat. watch it if you must because of the binge/hype value, but it has little to offer any serious film buff.\"] [\\'good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated.\\'] [\\'...but then i saw the american actors that play a role and i knew that all the acting was really bad. starts off shocking and kinda intriguing and fades into being dumb and boring. had a hard time paying attention by the end.\\'] [\\'good theme, but story developed in a bad way. poor direction idle for hr movie release than that of an episode series.\\'] [\\'i loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe.\\'] [\\'a great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $ mil american). they must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. like the sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. number six was the best for me. the sets are wes anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. the lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. the violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. the final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall i was highly entertained.\\'] [\\'i genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. a true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. when the carnage is occurring it\\\\\\'s nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the \"kill game\" genre that seems to always be elevated by korean talent behind and in front of the camera.\\'] [\\'this is an entertaining series from south korea that embodies elements of korean soap opera, chinese operatic acting and japanese theater. it uses classical chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting. it uses \"hunger games\" as it\\\\\\'s base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. the story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode . it then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. it is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven have to agree with the other comments about the group of \"actors\" playing the vips. they obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! enjoyable for what it\\\\\\'s meant to be!\\'] [\\'a tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses. combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to.\\'] [\\'for those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. basically, the series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you\\\\\\'ll definitely notice and say when you\\\\\\'re watching \"that character is me!\".  it is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. the same money that come from the blood and sweat of others. the capitalist system claims that there is equity and justice in the distribution of the wealth. and this is far from the truth. as for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. that they only find pleasure in people suffer.\\'] [\\'when he finally wins some money...only to lose it  seconds later, i turned it off and didnt come back for a while. but eventually i did and it is pretty good. of

show...being rich is just awful...lol korea must have lots of poor people.\\'] [\\'squid game is a great tv show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money. the tv show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money. i enjoyed the tv show: it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes. some mysteries also and some big revelations. i enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch. i will recommend anyone to watch this tv show. it was quite good.\\'] [\\'perfect to binge watching, this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted, twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments. while not really perfect, this is a perfectly fine netflix entertainment. totally recommended!\\'] [\"its different but the same basically

only once, since then you\\\\\\'ll know \"the secret\", and the mystery will be gone forever).\\'] [\\'really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. started very strong up until episode , then went downhill with all the vip stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. has great production values and acting. episode  was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how season  will turn out.\\'] [\\'this was a generally ok show. very typical of an anime series. just another game show game where people fight it out to the death. some sets were stupid like the arcade machines that could wipe surveillance footage of people in a hallway magically with one random arcade button. none of that \"typey typey break the code and delete\".. just.. \"okay this button should probably be pre-programed to erase evidence of stuff...  ended up not even being a part of the end story plot. yo.. hello. anyone listening? no answers on the harvest body parts?? just the \"you can sell them or eat them, i

can\\\\\\'t tell if the actors sucked of if it was the voice over actors ... first episodes drew me in as something new but series left me feeling like i just watched another dumb anime, not an exciting drama with original characters. this show revealed a lot to me about how people stereotype the rest of the world based on racist stereotypes... is all media propaganda in some way or another?\\'] [\\'in the first  episodes, there was a sense of potential in the series but as it progresses, it felt like the scriptwriters are just adding cliches. not something i would expect from a korean drama. i expected it to be unique, not your usual survival-themed series, and you know the type that gets you thinking. everything about this screams american: storyline, predictability, acting, character development? (if there is any), and concept. it was lackluster and i honestly was cringing just wishing it to be over. i predicted almost everything except gong yoo’s role. the casts are great! star-studded even. but when those foreigners started acting, i had the hardest cringe of my life. they made a bad series even worse. i’m not ecstatic for a season  but i can already smell a possible storyline. not to mention lee byung-hun’s brother who i presumed to be alive because the gunshot is not fatal. i’ll give season  the benefit of the doubt but i’m really sorry coz this season is not worth my time.\\'] [\\'probably the most horrible acting i have ever! seen. the writers of this probably wear goat masks and blow each-other just like in the show. the storyline is so bad that i think netflix should start recruiting people in grade . if they don’t already. by the way that idea is patent pending lol. i think i will run a series where netflix employees are given certain castings then imprisoned to play games to the death. that is yet another great idea just within a review! cheers.\\'] [\\'compelling, visually intriguing, exciting, fast paced and innovative. it has all the right credentials, apart from the inane and unnecessary violence. i don’t give a jot for all the reviews that say it’s a clever commentary on society today. it is not. it is a show that does nothing other than glorify death for no reason whatsoever. any clever commentary could have been communicated without the need for death. and worse the volume of people who are raving about it. what does that say about our society? that so many are utterly unaffected by such gratuitous murder - that it’s justifiable? that their lives were of no value and expendable just because they were financially ruined? i didn’t get what moral this show was trying to teach me, but surely there has to be some deeper truth to justify such macabre storytelling. i watched one episode and that was enough. shame on you netflix for peddling such brutality.\\'] [\\'one of the worst shows of the genre. the one star given is for aesthetics, but other than that the series delivers nothing more than a combination of ideas from other survival game dramas and movies. besides the dramatic acting approach and impressive setting, the series failed to deliver its messaging despite wanting to appear deep and introspective. mildly annoyed by how many perceive this show to be more clever and introspective than it is.  many aspects are not explained well, or there’s really no meaning behind them at all.\\'] [\\'not a fan of whole killing spree but the series was off to a good start with recruiting and with games. but major bummer was the end. wth was that ending? throughout the series it was conveyed to the audience the  is a good man except in marble game and then he just idling with his life for one whole year without fulfilling the promises he made for the last  dying ones in the game when he had billions in his account. ending was pathetic to the point make me feel it was such a waste of time watching all that. there are unwanted scenarios in the series.\\'] [\\'the idea of story is genius, smart but sorry to say i dont like this film because to many provide sadistic, violence, inhuman. many students of my country talking and interesting about this movie although their age are  not enough and not allowed to see the movie. hope if this film will be released in  series...could you please make it with softly?  because your movie inspired many people..thank you and success for your team\\'] [\\'i left the first episode with pain in my chest…literally. this show is not smart, not entertaining and an unfortunate representation of what we are expected to believe: that money and hate over-rule humanity. netflix does not fail in releasing one show after the other that depict the big lie; that humanity knows nothing but hate, jealousy, betrayal, anger and filth. the truth is that humanity is capable of so much love, but we will never see that on yet another mass propaganda channel. please spend your time spreading the right messages, serving the world to be a better place and indulging in good, smart and uplifting content…not this.\\'] [\"the filming and pace is okay, but most characters are inconsequential and lackluster. there\\'s no real meaningful character development in this series. many promising characters starting out, but most ended up being just plot devices to get the story moving. virtually nothing will change if you swap some of the main characters out. games are also extremely bland compared to similar pieces like liar game or alice in borderland. considering there are (without giving spoilers) quite a few a games and they take up significant amount of the screen time, the fact that there are almost no clever design to these games and how they play out is very disappointing. it is an okay series as pastime. however if you compare it to any serious predecessor in the genre, this one is quite pale in comparison especially at its core.\"] [\"if you like watching people get killed while playing children games for money at any cost to win or gamble w/their life to get out of a financial  crisis. then this is your  netflix tv series movie.  i found it to be downright disturbing considering the world we live in today it definitely fits into the grand scheme of things during this pandemic. what people will do for money especially when you are forced to make that decision. it shows who has morals or not.  in conclusion, definitely not my cup of tea but maybe someone else\\'s flavor.\"] [\\'but the story suffers in the ending. the reaction of the protagonist became abnormal to the point of him trying to kill a dying man on his deathbed (can he be a little compassionate like when he wanted to just stop the last game because he suddenly grew a conscience), talking slowly when he saw his mother lying on the floor (the normal reaction is to call for help immediately), and him living like a beggar for a year, not using his winnings. the ending would have been better when the last part was the scene from the atm, showing the whooping amount he earned.\\'] [\\'the main character is boring and relies on luck too much. the sets are creative but the characters have such basic and cookie cutter arcs. not to mention the parts with the doctor player were extremely boring, and many unnecessary scenes were added. the reveal at the end and the purpose of the squid game didn’t really have an effect. for me, it led to sort of a “so what” conclusion. a good show to kill time if you’ve got not much else to watch.\\'] [\"made it through most of episode  before bailing.  no sympathy for self-inflicted losers sob stories, and no interest in seeing the suffering they cause others.  the girl or the mother were the only redeeming characters, and watching them suffer offers no joy.  don\\'t care what happens to deranged gamblers, so why watch?  the acting is melodramatic caricatures, more cartoonish than appealing, and the concept is just absurd. the production values are high so  stars for that. just personal opinion.\"] [\\'the whole drama is vibrant, all actors performance is awesome, bringing the drama to a different level.\\'] [\\'its a good show but very sexist towards women. it showing young kids that men are stronger than women its disgusting. it will make girls feel like they cant grow up to stand up for themselves. they make women seem less than. overall should empower women more as their are a lot of women out

[\"the premise itself is good and the first few episodes are well-executed, but there\\'s a bit of a cultural clash regarding some of the tropes and the characters\\' mindsets when presented to a western audience. egalitarianism between the sexes isn\\'t as progressed in korea, so the repeated emphasis on the female players being weaker, undesirable teammates was pretty grating.\"] [\\'the ending was very disappointing, after such a large amount of character development i expected better. you do get to grow fond of characters, and there are many anticipated plot twists. some points in the storyline seemed like they were tied off hastily, somethings were left with lackluster if any answers. not sure if it’s a ploy to lead up to a second season, but i found myself literally angry at the end. for a character’s entire motive to just be abandoned at the last minute is just irritating. redemption was available many times over for the main character, just to be fumbled and squandered. production was gorgeous though. the vips would be more tolerable without any lines, as they remained anonymous and got away ultimately nothing would have been missed.\\'] [\"i binged it the entire day, and it was good but i didn\\'t like the ending too, but the acting was amazing plus the set\"] [\\'it’s wacky… it’s sappy… it goes from slapstick zany to blood splattering gruesome… and emotionally fluctuates with really extreme characters/situations. it’s kind of all over the place. in my opinion, it was ok. there were some characterizations and stereotypes that i found slightly offensive, and there were some elements that were so illogical, it completely pulled my focus out of the main actions. when a group of certain special people arrive, i think it gets kind of dumb. the colors and aesthetics of the costume/set design are stunning, but i think some of the masks are just way over the top.  i love mask. i’ve made masks, and often wear large obnoxious masks at halloween parties. i know how cumbersome and uncomfortable they can get. there’s no way some of the characters in the show would be wearing those gaudy, hot, heavy masks all the time. that said, the characters are mostly engaging, and story is bizarre enough to keep one watching till the end.\\'] [\\'a lot of people that is new to the genre might find this show entertaining. personally, i enjoyed some parts of this show. but most of the time,  i find myself questioning the simplicity of the games itself, the shallow plotline, building up moral compasses that leads to nowhere, and disappointing character developments (yeah i am talking about the main character: he is as selfish as he was during the first episode and the last episode).\\'] [\\'this is the first time i am putting my review for any tv series. squid game is definitely an engaging and intriguing series and a binge watch for all. the twist in the end was great, as i never saw that coming and the ending of the first season tells us that a second season is om its way soon.\\'] [\\'this series is very interesting and definitely keeps you wanting to watch more just because the events happening in the show. but honestly i had to watch the show in incriminates because if i watched too much at once i’d get sick to my stomach because this show is pretty gruesome. it shows pretty rough things and honestly makes you think how it’s rated # on netflix right now. personally i think no one under the age / should watch this series because of the events that happen. anyone with trauma i don’t think should watch this either because of the scenes. i don’t want to ruin anything for anyone who reads this but warning to all its gruesome.\\'] [\"i would like to write an honest review. i\\'m not going to write what people seeing on internet about show. truth is, it was a good series no doubt. acting skills are so damn good. but, it obviously bored you in last  episodes. where there is need of adreline rush obviously. episode , , , are best in the entire series. i would like to suggest you people, do not follow the hype created about the show on social network media. there are other series and movie better than that, but

few episodes were captivating, mostly for the shock factor. but unfortunately i think it fell off entirely after episode six (which is meant to be very sad, but how can we feel that sad for anyone when we have become so desensitised to people dying already?). there were a few \"should we just skip?\" moments in the last two episodes due to the drag. after finishing the show i felt a little unsatisfied. overall it was a well produced show and showcased some brilliant acting; even if the story falls off at the end. still worth a watch.\\'] [\"the only negative point of this series is it\\'s too slow plus many of the scenes are streched very unnecessarily. for eg:- in last episode, there\\'s a two way communication and it is been streched continuously for half and hours and it\\'s damn boring. i don\\'t know what the makers were thinking, they might have thought that yes we\\'re creating great suspense but no you\\'re making the audience feel bore. the positive things are the sets and performance. every actor just killed it in their role. also the sets were designed very beautifully for the task.\"] [\"the show has some really brilliant scenes but in the end comes to a predictable and tame ending. the ending could\\'ve been so much more. i would say a good watch for creative and concept value. as well as the performances by the entire cast.\"] [\"not a bad series but highly overated in my opinion. the story is old but the acting is superb. cruelty is similar to saw and tarantino. a lot of moral dilemmas arise as the show progresses. the uniforms and the playground songs are well placed. not recommended for anyone under . it can be rough for audiences that don\\'t like death games movies\"] [\"it is disturbing, gross and insane. the show isn\\'t binge worthy if you\\'re easily triggered by violence. deep down it is a lesson how nostalgia & the urge to make money can actually kill you.\"] [\"the series had a motive of showing the people that they are actually different kinds of animals in the world. but there is a difference animals don\\'t think , alternatively humans do. they are very ugly inside. actually we don\\'t have feelings at all, we use it for our own advantage. humans always  consider for their selves  first  and then their loved ones. this series will give you how people are seen in different situations when they are placed. money will buy you everything but we , humans are never ever satisfied.\"] [\\'fantastic show to begin with - really hooks you in and it becomes essential to watch till the end. as the show progresses however it does begin to get somewhat tiresome, cliché and there are some really drawn out episodes towards the end that drag with some questionable writing.\\'] [\\'my oh my goodness this season excited me and to be brutally honest first episode i didn’t have much clue to what it was about, i hadn’t even watched a trailer for it and to be honest i don’t really like the name of the show squid game. but the a old saying in life don’t judge a book by its cover and i guess that old saying rings true here.\\'] [\\'ending was dragged out a bit and although they have made it very suggestive of a possible season , the fact it was dragged out this way has definitely decreased the ending scenes quality significantly, however if it had not done this i could not see this advancing into a second season smoothly if at all.\\'] [\\'absolutely amazing show. i have never left a review on any show i’ve ever watched in my entire life but i recommend this show to everyone. the plot is not predictable which i find very intriguing. kudos to the creators because this show, it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society. not only does this show keep you hooked, but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole. with all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one i’ve seen to date. there are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all i highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you. it’s much needed perspective growth that more people should delve into.\\'] [\"this show is really amazing, you can feel each characters emotions and feeling well. the first half of this show make you feel various kind of feelings just like roller coaster is going on and then in the half, its become heavy and tense. last of the episodes are really heart wrenching  i mean i can\\'t hold my tears it was to heavy.. well this show won\\'t let you down in any aspects.\"] [\\'i haven’t watch any type of production so damn moving emotionally. albeit this show is extremely emotionally and mentally draining, it truly is personally moving and simply amazing work done by the writer/creator, production staff, director and actors whom simply make this show one of the greatest film or movie i’ve ever laud witness to. the character building alone is that of legendary status while each of the main casts actors are so perfectly cast and act their roles in ways i didn’t expect. this isn’t just a korean hunger games by any means but more like a human case study on our nature and society as human beings. this is a must watch for all adults as i’m sure young people will love the violence and story but adults will immediately relate with this show on so many levels\\'] [\"i finished this series in  days! it keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you can\\'t stop watching!! one complaint i have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field  (*cough* clickbait *cough*) but squid game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective. the acting and character development is so good, you really feel for the characters which makes their demise that much more devastating. this show is a must watch!\"] [\"i binged this show and i loved it, everyone i recommended this show to loved it. great characters and a well-written story, that makes you want more. i\\'ve never left reviews before but squid game deserves it! the acting is amazing, even for the guards who you can\\'t see their faces but they still hold a lot of emotion. (spoilers) i loved rewatching it and finding all the hints i missed about the games on the wall, or player  not being scanned during red light green light. the characters were so well written and even relatable that it was truly sad to see them die.

haven\\'t seen a drama for a while, the storys usually seem to get repetitive and quite predictable but not this one! apart from the fact that it was obvious the protagonist would survive since the story revolved around him, every episode was packed with twists at every turn, really had me on up my toes!! it was so refreshing to watch a such a clever and well-thought out drama with some very thought-provoking life lessons ! the cast, needless to say, made it all the more worth watching.. i am a korean drama addict but squid game really has the potential to get anyone hooked! its that good!\"] [\"i have never written a review for a show before, but this one was so good that i honestly just had to, especially since i finished the series in  days! unlike alice in borderland, which many claim to be similar to this show, squid game truly makes you feel connected to the characters, which ultimately makes their demise all the more heartbreaking. the show is not as gory as some japanese counterparts, but definitely does make you feel uneasy/unsettled. love how the show ties together children\\'s games and twists them into something far more sinister. i truly hope to see a season  soon!\"] [\"wow, i was truly blown away by this amazing series. every single thing about this show draws you in and it keeps you hooked. i stayed up way later then i should\\'ve when having to go to work the next day, just to keep watching. the acting couldn\\'t be better, the idea is similar to others, but this one is still so original at the same time. it had a little bit of every genre in this to where i know anyone would end up liking this series. i\\'ve really been enjoying a lot of the south korean series that netflix has been streaming lately. i hope they keep it up and i will be so upset if this doesn\\'t get a season !!\"] [\"i finished this series in just  day!

i really liked watching this the hidden message seems to be about the crisis of debt in south korea and just how far some desperate people are willing to do for some cash. i thought it was a very intense adventure that was followed, such an entertaining craft this show has been made into. i avoided the reviews upon watching, instead i decided to give it a go and i\\'m glad i did as its very engaging to the point you cannot watch one episode, this is definitely a bingeworthy one to catch as soon as possible, before the internet ruins it for you. i definitely recommend watching this, some moments will have you laughing although others will have you the complete opposite, it got me good on some parts in both ways. check it out!

emotional at times. check it out!!\\'] [\"i watched episode  on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series, and they were absolutely right. i was captured right away. the series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing. beware, cause there is more than enough violence in the series, and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters, at the same time that you despise others. keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events. you probably won\\'t see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often. the best thing about this series is the acting. my mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances. there are true emmy or oscar level performances throughout the show. one of the best series i\\'ve watched in a long time.\"] [\\'i wanted to like this. i love asian film and tv from most of their countries, and this entry started interesting enough but even some of the initial elements forbode what my instincts told me would be a lame ending, thus maintaining the \"we don\\\\\\'t care what we put out\" tradition of crappy netflix fare.  hours to a horrible disappointing payoff. it started to go off the rails and become a self righteous preachy mess around episode . i won\\\\\\'t give away the ending but i warned you, though i\\\\\\'m sure the lemmings who follow anything will applaud it.\\'] [\\'bad acting and foolish composition. i just cannot grasp why people rate this over  points. really. if it dosent take more than something like this to get great rating, the quality perception has really deteriorated during the pandemic.\\'] [\"i seriously don\\'t know what the hype is all about. is it because people get killed while playing a game? is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey? because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better. to me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long.\"] [\"started well. but mid way through, it gets tired and feels sluggish. the games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc. the ending was horrible and vague.it shows that losers will be losers even after winning. just not relevant in today\\'s world.\"] [\\'nothing more than a korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc. terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes. probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy, anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time.\\'] [\\'this show has a great script, excellent actors, but fails to keep the viewers interested, because it is really slow. i often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer, adding very little to the plot. this show could easily have  episodes, and that would improve a lot its entertaining value.\\'] [\"quickly became my favorite show of all time. honestly, i found it extraordinary. one of the very few times i\\'ve found a show worthy of all the hype. from the cinematography to the concept and everything in between. but please watch it with subtitles! it makes a huge difference. i watched it dubbed the second time amd it takes so much away.\"] [\"very entertaining and high in production quality, but it suffered from some predictable writing and over the top acting issues. it was obvious from the get go who was going to win and last the longest because those were characters that received the most development. however, some of the plot twists worked, including the one at the end. most episodes were well paced and a pleasure to watch thanks to lots of brutal action and decent dialogue, but the episode when everybody left could have been better. i\\'ll also say that the red hair ending and not getting on the plane was a bit weird, and it was disappointing not hearing anything more about the police officer considering how op he was earlier on. several characters were overdone acting and dialogue wise, like the woman who struggled to find a team and the main character in places. however, there was a good mix of characters, the acting was generally impressive, and the extras did a good job. then the cinematography, sets/props/costumes, visual effects, editing, and soundtrack were all excellent for a tv show.\"] [\"this show was terrible. don\\'t waste your time.\"] [\\'believe the hype. truly awesome tv.\\'] [\\'boring and predictable\\'] [\\'let s start saying that eastern culture is completely different from the western..said that i don t understand how this show is popular in europe, us... this is just the proof that people follow what is popular. many asian might find this serie amazing but from a western guy point of view i have to say: - acting was terrible, a lot of overreaction for nothing. read that dubbing was bad. not at all, that s how asians talk and behave. if you didn t like the dubbing is because you don t like the style, as different from your culture. - everything in the movie was very predictable (at least untill episode , then i stopped watching). - extremely forced and pointless emotional scene, build up on hypocrisy and very obvious cliches. the idea itself was nothing new but good, the rest rubbish. i could like it if i was asian or maybe  years old (without splatter scene)\\'] [\"this show is very overrated and over-hyped. it\\'s a unique concept but it feels very unoriginal. with all that said it was very entertaining show that keeps the viewers engaged throughout most of it. it\\'s very detailed and one of my favorite details is the main characters number. with his number in the game being  it was a constant reminder of how many other players there were. overall it\\'s worth a watch, but goes over the top in the genre every once in a while.\"] [\"i don\\'t honestly understand the plot line or attraction to this show.\"] [\"i don\\'t know how anyone could not like this show? i\\'m looking forward to netflix\\'s future foreign offerings!\"] [\\'finally finished. the writing was fairly obvious and very heavy handed, but overall it was entertaining.\\'] [\"this was one of those shows where once it hooks you, you\\'re along for the ride. and what a great ride it was.\"] [\\'three stars for a great first few episodes, - star for not holding the quality till the end\\'] [\\'absolute loved this series!

              "'i know korea is still a mysoginistic society until now because there government doesnt want women to have power and more equal rights than men and thats the sad truth of the society but judging the story it felt flat for me the beginning episodes are great but after episode  it felt draggy and slow and i get the betrayal of friends part but i think it feels so injustice of the other characters especially ali they didi him dirty and still koreans always look down dark or brown skinned people i hate it here and still racist to foreigners ngl though and the ending is still open ended so weed a nd season to answer all the several plotholes of previous episodes acting is phenomenal hands down especially saebyeok i love her role in this its giving me katnis everdeen vibes heheheh purr and gihun too i love his kind honest protagonist and especially the front man i love villainess of the characters high budget production outfits stages evrything felt flat for the ost i need lisas money fpr the ost of the nd season please it matches the series thats all yall should watch alice in borderland it has better plot than the squid game purr the show was amazing the way i was crying for characters i have only known them for  episodes is just crazy cause this is the first time it has happened to me the way they have developed the characters even if we dont know that much about their background other than gihun but honestly they never tell us anything like why he debt or any other information so its crazy how i started crying this also just proves how the acting is just amazing and i loved the cast and they fit so well with the roles and the chemistry with each other was amazing too also i was so happy seeing a south asian character because its not very common to see them and even if you do see them they are small roles no main characters so i was very very happy about that me being an indian myself the music was also so good the song matched the vibe so well such as when they played happy songs in bad situations it really matched well with the childrens game theme or the pink soldiers song gave such an eerie vibe but i kept wanting to listen to the song even though it kinda freaked me out a little lastly i loved the story so much but if im going to be honest the story was pretty basic but it was still so addicting and i binged the whole show in one sitting so i still totally reccomed watching i love this show so much and im so happy for the show and the actors for all the international attention this show is getting and other kdramas suddenly getting after squid game like the stories are so good they deserve it yayyyy squid game was truly something else i expected a bunch of games but did i expect everything that happened during and after the games no definitely not this obviously needs a season  since the ending was kind of crappy dont get me wrong the beginning and the show in general was excellent however i wish the ending was a little more developed seong gi hoon was an interesting character he was naïve of a sort even though he was been through a lot even after what happened at the end he continued to live his life the way it was before cho sang woo honestly did not deserve to last so long in the games this man was dangerous and we couldnt even detect it kang sae byeok was the best character hands down she faced everything headon which is something i want to do whenever im in the middle of a situation hwang jun ho was pretty irrelevant in my opinion because his purpose was to only find his brother who went missing the hot thing about him was that he always used the words of someone whenever he was violated theres no closure about him which i wish did happen hopefully in season  well get closure about him ali was too innocent in this drama all he wanted was money for his wife and kid poor guy couldnt even get anything but he left his family a good amount oh il nami dont know i have a confusing view about him he treated the guys so nice but at the end what he explained was messed up ji yeong was also badass her ending is undeserved she deserved a second chance theres a bunch of other characters i would have reviewed but meh its whatever lol its competent in most aspects the hype honestly makes it a worse experience because you expect something mindblowing and genre breaking its not that its battle royale fall guys its mostly enjoyable the social commentary is a bit heavy handed at times but its nice to have it there its not that original its not perfect its fine  random note the scenes with english speaking foreigners were hilarious the writing was mostly ok but it didnt come off as entirely natural and combined with notstellar acting it felt odd i guess like asian scenes feel in western movies maybe yeah worth the hype i wasnt wowed by the first episode of this drama nor entirely enchanted by the second but by the end of the second episode i thought dang okay fine i guess i want to keep watching and im glad i did the most thrilling and emotional parts of this show took place within the game itself the games are simple childrens games but are games that dont necessarily require skill most of the time its luck which number you drew which shape you got that sort of thing the game purports to be fair but its only fair in the way that real life is fair youre stuck with the cards youve been given the poor characters take part in the game because the real world is so terrible for them that the game is the best alternative theyve got sadly some even think they can win despite as weve discussed the games being largely luckbased the characters are mostly pretty decent in this the main character gi hoon is initially kind of a piece of trash but you realize that hes a gambling addict and this leads to him hurting the people he loves hes not an inherently bad person who wants to hurt others and you see that come out in the game where hes one of the kinder people there the rest of the cast are also great not a weak performance in sight id say the cops plotline and character are mildly confusing and vague and youre just not that emotionally invested in it compared to everyone else the show continues to get better and better as the games keep going and people dienpeople die in very emotionally impacting ways and i think they did all the character deaths very well they often feel different too whether its because it was accidental somebody cheated so they lost or just bad luck and the deaths can weirdly almost feel like a part of their character arcs i dont know how the writers pulled it off but they did it well tldr its really worth watching because its not just trashy fun it has so much to say about the unfairness of the systems in this world that keep poor people down im not sure id rewatch it because its so emotionally overwhelming at times but it is super good average for its genre  dont get me wrong this is a pretty decent show but at the same time the ending didnt satisfied me at all it ended like this in order to have more seasons ofc but idk for me it lacked smt survival movies or tv shows are never a concept i find revolutionary so i think its pretty funny how of all the kdramas out there this one is the most watched on netflix not only that but its the top most watched shows on netlix of all time i understand everything and all that but if i ever survived such a crazy hell i would either end up killing myself regardless or just really living and doing everything ive ever wanted might as well whats the worst that can happen i watched this on the spur of the moment after having  intention of watching it previously because tbh how many times have mangaanime fans seen this survival game concept growing up with japanese entertainment nothing about this show was new at all but i still loved it i suppose for westerners it might be new but for me the shock factors or disturbing qualities didnt stand out from originality but from the pure execution i could say the majority of the plot turns were predictable as well but the pacing and performances were so good that it kept me on the edge of my seat the violencegore wasnt emotionally or mentally straining and was easy to get to used to after the initial shocks of the first two episodes i loved the detective passionately d and not just because that man is incredibly fine but his character addition really added to the quick pacing of the show mixing in another storyline so as to almost give us a breather from the dirty inhumane warehouse feeling the other characters endured i believe that the alternations of characterstory focuses was what was really done well because it always kept you rolling and focused a next next next action experience the only reason im not giving it a  is because i really felt that the ending of some characters was rushed episode  definitely lacked the full emotional appeal of loss for me and i was mildly disappointed but i understand there was a time crunch ive never stayed up all night to watch a show before but i did for squid game i was absolutely groggy the next day but it was worth it im currently rewatching it with my mom and it is still an incredibly crisp viewing the camerawork and colors were executed very very well and i look forward to watching hwang dong hyuks other works the novelty of squid game thats all over media is  western hype in my opinion but tbh with how well done this show was it probably deserves it i wasnt sure at first that this would be for me im usually more of a romance based story lover but this really surprised me squid game has no romance and i wasnt bothered in the least about it i was just an interesting story with morally grey compelling characters im a bit confused about the ending im not sure if they did it that way so that there could possibly be another season or just to make the viewer think but overall this kept me very engaged and i really liked it a lot if the creators were to do another show set in this world i would love to see more about how it started how the workers are chosen and just more about the frontman the frontman had the potential to be a really interesting character the story just wasnt focusing on him i just want to know why he chose to join the game maybe even spoilers see what his original game was like and ultimately led him to abandon his family and become a major part of the game a brilliant show fully worth watching this is a show that is simultaneously brutal and beautiful in its depiction and execution its a fantastic metaphor for capitalism and the illusion of autonomy the compulsion to survive that drives the poorest when their supposed freedoms and choices are constrained by a need to survive anyone could have left the game but out in the real world the pressures would not let them so they stayed and played  i thought gihun was a weak and unsympathetic character i didnt like the actors constipated expressions at everything and i thought the support cast was better in terms of sympathetic characters and acting the plot itself was formulaic but still great lot of the deaths were foreshadowed but that often made the prelude thick with emotional suspense and a desperation to be proven wrong the games were brutal and i thought in particular that episodes  and  were masterful again i felt let down by the main character and i also found everything on the side with the undercover policeman to be an unnecessary addition which could instead have been devoted to fleshing out the back stories of some of the other characters i found the north korean defector sorry i cant remember her name the most interesting whilst ali and the old man were the most endearing this show really though could only be endured if you hated the characters as soon as you began liking someone they were bound to die copied storyline with a weird ending and way too much blood i watched this because everyone keeeps talking about this seriespostitive points very good production high quality the actors gave a great performance really cant say anything bad about that negative points the whole story is just well it reminds me a lot of alice in borderland expect that alice in borderland was a lot better in my opinion the ending of squid game is kinda predictable and not satisfying at all there isnt really a happy ending for anyone tbh i dont get the hype there are way better korean asian series out there still i think its cool that people start recognizing korean  asian series movies more  if you like blood gore and mind fck this series is for you if you dont better watch something else squid game is one of the most exciting series to hit netflix in some time it mashes up the carefree idyllic days of childhood with the brutal realism of adulthood as it forces everyday people to compete in life or death matches in a bid to potentially wipe out their debts equal parts gutwrenching and squirminducing it’s a whiteknuckle thriller drama and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer it’s one of the most unique things you’ll watch this year  and maybe ever show was lame very weirdly paced and slow it wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee dont follow the hype either idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense you dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show this show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as br skip this or watch if your bored the fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews including the established critics celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the st century so much is wrong with this series yes the whole idea behind it that i hardly know where to start but ill try the purely cinematic criticism first the character development is ad hoc in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible the character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script the supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else scattered in to show humanity friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there they are ultimately not figures in themselves the cinematography is okay but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic which is so full of wealth greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such antivalues but their celebration the music  the score are completely irrelevant and immature they have no influence on the film the script has as many gaps as a swiss cheese and storylines go untold the actors are sometimes like that but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory they often only convey one and when the going gets tough maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings aside from these obvious aspects however the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hideandseek the producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth unscrupulousness greed for money and in the ultimate end a moral story about ethics humanity and humanism but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath interested in topics instead the show should and will be driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance the last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively a game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here artistic love for the medium of film or an affection for pop culture none of it i have a hard time expressing how much i hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away our world like ancient rome seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time have fun and welcome to the squid games im out starts off pretty well in the first episode then its just downhill and pointless the ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crap it turns out everything is dread nothing has any meaning and no one gets happy for anything doom gloom and bad acting is all you get after now over  unhelpfuls here we go again guys i dont know what to say squid game is not a good show its garbage i hope there wont be a season  a spin off or a movie watch the first episode if you cant resist the marketing hype youll see its a  but since these few points  due to the fresh storyline  are undeserved its heavily inspired by the mangaanime kaiji and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies ill give it a  abysmal overacting puppet characters unrealistic and unrefined stuff even teens which are the main target once the novelty factor fades will recognize that its trash sadly and stupidly i watched every episode  easily predictable on what happens and whos who the acting is woeful with even worse dubbing if i can remember who recommended this to me id throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting  hours of my life on utter dross its not unique its not different its all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surprise if i can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done  could not relate to the story or any of the characters just didnt even care who lives who dies loopholes in the story galore unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter in the end was like yawn whatever no issues with gore in movies seen plenty in others but the storyactingscreenplay should hold and carry the movie through this felt like it is riding on the wave movies like parasite created for korean cinematv bloated overhyped nonsense at best give it a skip and save your time could barely get through the first  mins of this extremely boring cheesy unstimulating i kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on a lot of over acting i do not understand what the hype is all about this is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games dont want just waste of time only a sociopath will like watching something like this the show has very negative energy and it affects the audience if you dont realise that im sorry for you i love thrillers and horror movies if they have a point in them this is too much because there are literally so many people living in debt especially now during covid and the suicide rates have skyrocketed because of it this is not funny nor interesting nor enjoyable to watch therefore i vote it in the gutter because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it the talk and reviews have me bewildered im only up to ep but am struggling after about  attempts to start bingeing i find it boring and really childish with pretty ordinary acting the set design art direction and general production values are very s two more attempts then ill give up its really not that good highly predictable and the ending was terrible i will say though the main character and his acting wasnt too bad enjoyed watching him but other than that its a waste of time anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series let me preface no i am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it i have seen many horrorthrillers including the death game genre so while i thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones i cant wrap my head around the hype many people bring up how it is similar to x game book movie etc so im thinking netflix created a way for casual and nonhorror viewers to get exposure to it thinking its new or innovating complaints about that aside the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainmentwise for me it is watchable for sure but certain characters mainly the cop are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or rewritten also annoying is yes the vips act horribly and yes everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being theres only one winner in summary was it good depends on personal taste was it genius unique or without flaws absolutely not i didnt enjoy it enough to binge but it made for a decent casual viewing id suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be first off the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in takashi miikes kamisama no iu tôri it almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director  second i mostly have experience with south korean horror movies and ive always thought that south korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted japanese and chinese but the acting in squid game definitely feels more theatrical which is not a good thing imo its hard to connect with the story and the actors when theyre expressing every emotion with shouting flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces this might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in asia but i prefer the realistic kind the show was decent worth watching but not as great as some are saying took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing get ready for season  you know not that bad considering overhype ephemera no more but has a good picture music and lets say not so banal development of events of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer but for most series and viewers lets say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement usually it is so strongest side of this series is an acting it is really solid i think considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as  a hype is a hype is a hype and our actual societys zeitgeist the series is far away from the mentioned masterpiece its starts very good the first  parts are very enjoyable but then it goes down quite quickly everything is far too obvious from the beginning everything is so clear not one single surprise to the end and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline the bad dialogues and the overacting furthermore full of plotholes another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes all in all nothing special how is this currently on a score of  the lead character was so annoying in the first  minutes that i switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through its not a patch on either battle royale or the american version of that hunger games it drags on and on and on and the ending is just flat watch it if you must because of the bingehype value but it has little to offer any serious film buff good idea for a show but poor execution of it totally overrated but then i saw the american actors that play a role and i knew that all the acting was really bad starts off shocking and kinda intriguing and fades into being dumb and boring had a hard time paying attention by the end good theme but story developed in a bad way poor direction idle for hr movie release than that of an episode series i loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe a great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of moneyapparently  mil american they must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing like the sopranos with some of the episodes better than others number six was the best for me the sets are wes anderson like with bright colors filling the screen the lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written the violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight the final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall i was highly entertained i genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end a true social commentary on humanity competition and avarice when the carnage is occurring its nailbiting and between the games you get compelling human drama  a fantastic addition to the kill game genre that seems to always be elevated by korean talent behind and in front of the camera this is an entertaining series from south korea that embodies elements of korean soap opera chinese operatic acting and japanese theater it uses classical chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and angerand a lot of shouting it uses hunger games as its base and survival of the fittest as its main theme the story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode  it then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode it is set up for a second season if one can judge from the final episode but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven have to agree with the other comments about the group of actors playing the vips they obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all enjoyable for what its meant to be a tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to for those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series basically the series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that youll definitely notice and say when youre watching that character is me  it is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end the same money that come from the blood and sweat of others the capitalist system claims that there is equity and justice in the distribution of the wealth and this is far from the truth as for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process money is no longer their pleasure that they only find pleasure in people suffer when he finally wins some moneyonly to lose it  seconds later i turned it off and didnt come back for a while but eventually i did and it is pretty good of course it drags  minute episodes into  hour long episodesbut its still good both twists were so predictable the police brother and the old man were so obviousand what is the message of the showbeing rich is just awfullol korea must have lots of poor people squid game is a great tv show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money the tv show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money i enjoyed the tv show it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes some mysteries also and some big revelations i enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch i will recommend anyone to watch this tv show it was quite good perfect to binge watching this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments while not really perfect this is a perfectly fine netflix entertainment totally recommended its different but the same basically a different take on the violent game shows were nobody really wins episode  was the best episode if theres a season two it needs to be the revenge if you enjoy korean movies then this is a must see has become a real hit cool idea interesting games and drama plenty of story to continue more seasons  ive got final  eps left but have really enjoyed up to this point typical korean ott actionand some real life back stories thrown in for good measure was good to see a non korean ali abdul in this thoroughly entertaining and a great distraction from all the madness in the world this tv show is very good to me something different from what we are used to watch for me is very original this is the first korean drama ive watched while i was absolutely blown away there were a couple of moments where i thought the story dragged a little however it was all added for tension im sure it was absolutely stunning to look at and really well done i cant wait to see what happens in the next series great show korean drama that is perceivable for n american audience similar story attempts have been made in the past but this one has a great blend of drama with a little unpleasantries wow no show has ever stressed me out as much as this one it was seriously insane and crazy and hilarious all at once kept me on the edge of my seat thats for sure it had me laughing and crying and terrified well directed pretty good writing uneven acting partly over the top theatrical partly just as it should be well produced and shot keeps viewers attention slightly predictable at moments and in general masterfully edited and with an appropriate music score as the tile says good watch but only once since then youll know the secret and the mystery will be gone forever really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin started very strong up until episode  then went downhill with all the vip stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on has great production values and acting episode  was the best one by a mile but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how season  will turn out this was a generally ok show very typical of an anime series just another game show game where people fight it out to the death some sets were stupid like the arcade machines that could wipe surveillance footage of people in a hallway magically with one random arcade button none of that typey typey break the code and delete just okay this button should probably be preprogramed to erase evidence of stuff  ended up not even being a part of the end story plot yo hello anyone listening no answers on the harvest body parts just the you can sell them or eat them i dont care but part then boom that entire plot is gone seriously i have picked apart this entire series and its just absolutely a typical live action anime bad dub and all i cant tell if the actors sucked of if it was the voice over actors  first episodes drew me in as something new but series left me feeling like i just watched another dumb anime not an exciting drama with original characters this show revealed a lot to me about how people stereotype the rest of the world based on racist stereotypes is all media propaganda in some way or another in the first  episodes there was a sense of potential in the series but as it progresses it felt like the scriptwriters are just adding cliches not something i would expect from a korean drama i expected it to be unique not your usual survivalthemed series and you know the type that gets you thinking everything about this screams american storyline predictability acting character development if there is any and concept it was lackluster and i honestly was cringing just wishing it to be over i predicted almost everything except gong yoo’s role the casts are great starstudded even but when those foreigners started acting i had the hardest cringe of my life they made a bad series even worse i’m not ecstatic for a season  but i can already smell a possible storyline not to mention lee byunghun’s brother who i presumed to be alive because the gunshot is not fatal i’ll give season  the benefit of the doubt but i’m really sorry coz this season is not worth my time probably the most horrible acting i have ever seen the writers of this probably wear goat masks and blow eachother just like in the show the storyline is so bad that i think netflix should start recruiting people in grade  if they don’t already by the way that idea is patent pending lol i think i will run a series where netflix employees are given certain castings then imprisoned to play games to the death that is yet another great idea just within a review cheers compelling visually intriguing exciting fast paced and innovative it has all the right credentials apart from the inane and unnecessary violence i don’t give a jot for all the reviews that say it’s a clever commentary on society today it is not it is a show that does nothing other than glorify death for no reason whatsoever any clever commentary could have been communicated without the need for death and worse the volume of people who are raving about it what does that say about our society that so many are utterly unaffected by such gratuitous murder  that it’s justifiable that their lives were of no value and expendable just because they were financially ruined i didn’t get what moral this show was trying to teach me but surely there has to be some deeper truth to justify such macabre storytelling i watched one episode and that was enough shame on you netflix for peddling such brutality one of the worst shows of the genre the one star given is for aesthetics but other than that the series delivers nothing more than a combination of ideas from other survival game dramas and movies besides the dramatic acting approach and impressive setting the series failed to deliver its messaging despite wanting to appear deep and introspective mildly annoyed by how many perceive this show to be more clever and introspective than it is  many aspects are not explained well or there’s really no meaning behind them at all not a fan of whole killing spree but the series was off to a good start with recruiting and with games but major bummer was the end wth was that ending throughout the series it was conveyed to the audience the  is a good man except in marble game and then he just idling with his life for one whole year without fulfilling the promises he made for the last  dying ones in the game when he had billions in his account ending was pathetic to the point make me feel it was such a waste of time watching all that there are unwanted scenarios in the series the idea of story is genius smart but sorry to say i dont like this film because to many provide sadistic violence inhuman many students of my country talking and interesting about this movie although their age are  not enough and not allowed to see the movie hope if this film will be released in  seriescould you please make it with softly  because your movie inspired many peoplethank you and success for your team i left the first episode with pain in my chest…literally this show is not smart not entertaining and an unfortunate representation of what we are expected to believe that money and hate overrule humanity netflix does not fail in releasing one show after the other that depict the big lie that humanity knows nothing but hate jealousy betrayal anger and filth the truth is that humanity is capable of so much love but we will never see that on yet another mass propaganda channel please spend your time spreading the right messages serving the world to be a better place and indulging in good smart and uplifting content…not this the filming and pace is okay but most characters are inconsequential and lackluster theres no real meaningful character development in this series many promising characters starting out but most ended up being just plot devices to get the story moving virtually nothing will change if you swap some of the main characters out games are also extremely bland compared to similar pieces like liar game or alice in borderland considering there are without giving spoilers quite a few a games and they take up significant amount of the screen time the fact that there are almost no clever design to these games and how they play out is very disappointing it is an okay series as pastime however if you compare it to any serious predecessor in the genre this one is quite pale in comparison especially at its core if you like watching people get killed while playing children games for money at any cost to win or gamble wtheir life to get out of a financial  crisis then this is your  netflix tv series movie  i found it to be downright disturbing considering the world we live in today it definitely fits into the grand scheme of things during this pandemic what people will do for money especially when you are forced to make that decision it shows who has morals or not  in conclusion definitely not my cup of tea but maybe someone elses flavor but the story suffers in the ending the reaction of the protagonist became abnormal to the point of him trying to kill a dying man on his deathbed can he be a little compassionate like when he wanted to just stop the last game because he suddenly grew a conscience talking slowly when he saw his mother lying on the floor the normal reaction is to call for help immediately and him living like a beggar for a year not using his winnings the ending would have been better when the last part was the scene from the atm showing the whooping amount he earned the main character is boring and relies on luck too much the sets are creative but the characters have such basic and cookie cutter arcs not to mention the parts with the doctor player were extremely boring and many unnecessary scenes were added the reveal at the end and the purpose of the squid game didn’t really have an effect for me it led to sort of a “so what” conclusion a good show to kill time if you’ve got not much else to watch made it through most of episode  before bailing  no sympathy for selfinflicted losers sob stories and no interest in seeing the suffering they cause others  the girl or the mother were the only redeeming characters and watching them suffer offers no joy  dont care what happens to deranged gamblers so why watch  the acting is melodramatic caricatures more cartoonish than appealing and the concept is just absurd the production values are high so  stars for that just personal opinion the whole drama is vibrant all actors performance is awesome bringing the drama to a different level its a good show but very sexist towards women it showing young kids that men are stronger than women its disgusting it will make girls feel like they cant grow up to stand up for themselves they make women seem less than overall should empower women more as their are a lot of women out their who work their but off to fight and be strong overall good show also is this off how korea treats those who are poor should have made women to be seen as more confident and stronger the premise itself is good and the first few episodes are wellexecuted but theres a bit of a cultural clash regarding some of the tropes and the characters mindsets when presented to a western audience egalitarianism between the sexes isnt as progressed in korea so the repeated emphasis on the female players being weaker undesirable teammates was pretty grating the ending was very disappointing after such a large amount of character development i expected better you do get to grow fond of characters and there are many anticipated plot twists some points in the storyline seemed like they were tied off hastily somethings were left with lackluster if any answers not sure if it’s a ploy to lead up to a second season but i found myself literally angry at the end for a character’s entire motive to just be abandoned at the last minute is just irritating redemption was available many times over for the main character just to be fumbled and squandered production was gorgeous though the vips would be more tolerable without any lines as they remained anonymous and got away ultimately nothing would have been missed i binged it the entire day and it was good but i didnt like the ending too but the acting was amazing plus the set it’s wacky… it’s sappy… it goes from slapstick zany to blood splattering gruesome… and emotionally fluctuates with really extreme characterssituations it’s kind of all over the place in my opinion it was ok there were some characterizations and stereotypes that i found slightly offensive and there were some elements that were so illogical it completely pulled my focus out of the main actions when a group of certain special people arrive i think it gets kind of dumb the colors and aesthetics of the costumeset design are stunning but i think some of the masks are just way over the top  i love mask i’ve made masks and often wear large obnoxious masks at halloween parties i know how cumbersome and uncomfortable they can get there’s no way some of the characters in the show would be wearing those gaudy hot heavy masks all the time that said the characters are mostly engaging and story is bizarre enough to keep one watching till the end a lot of people that is new to the genre might find this show entertaining personally i enjoyed some parts of this show but most of the time  i find myself questioning the simplicity of the games itself the shallow plotline building up moral compasses that leads to nowhere and disappointing character developments yeah i am talking about the main character he is as selfish as he was during the first episode and the last episode this is the first time i am putting my review for any tv series squid game is definitely an engaging and intriguing series and a binge watch for all the twist in the end was great as i never saw that coming and the ending of the first season tells us that a second season is om its way soon this series is very interesting and definitely keeps you wanting to watch more just because the events happening in the show but honestly i had to watch the show in incriminates because if i watched too much at once i’d get sick to my stomach because this show is pretty gruesome it shows pretty rough things and honestly makes you think how it’s rated  on netflix right now personally i think no one under the age  should watch this series because of the events that happen anyone with trauma i don’t think should watch this either because of the scenes i don’t want to ruin anything for anyone who reads this but warning to all its gruesome i would like to write an honest review im not going to write what people seeing on internet about show truth is it was a good series no doubt acting skills are so damn good but it obviously bored you in last  episodes where there is need of adreline rush obviously episode    are best in the entire series i would like to suggest you people do not follow the hype created about the show on social network media there are other series and movie better than that but didnt get praised all those hype they had created on social media is paid n one mormost important thing i fall sleep watching this show twice now you can conclude on your own the first few episodes were captivating mostly for the shock factor but unfortunately i think it fell off entirely after episode six which is meant to be very sad but how can we feel that sad for anyone when we have become so desensitised to people dying already there were a few should we just skip moments in the last two episodes due to the drag after finishing the show i felt a little unsatisfied overall it was a well produced show and showcased some brilliant acting even if the story falls off at the end still worth a watch the only negative point of this series is its too slow plus many of the scenes are streched very unnecessarily for eg in last episode theres a two way communication and it is been streched continuously for half and hours and its damn boring i dont know what the makers were thinking they might have thought that yes were creating great suspense but no youre making the audience feel bore the positive things are the sets and performance every actor just killed it in their role also the sets were designed very beautifully for the task the show has some really brilliant scenes but in the end comes to a predictable and tame ending the ending couldve been so much more i would say a good watch for creative and concept value as well as the performances by the entire cast not a bad series but highly overated in my opinion the story is old but the acting is superb cruelty is similar to saw and tarantino a lot of moral dilemmas arise as the show progresses the uniforms and the playground songs are well placed not recommended for anyone under  it can be rough for audiences that dont like death games movies it is disturbing gross and insane the show isnt binge worthy if youre easily triggered by violence deep down it is a lesson how nostalgia  the urge to make money can actually kill you the series had a motive of showing the people that they are actually different kinds of animals in the world but there is a difference animals dont think  alternatively humans do they are very ugly inside actually we dont have feelings at all we use it for our own advantage humans always  consider for their selves  first  and then their loved ones this series will give you how people are seen in different situations when they are placed money will buy you everything but we  humans are never ever satisfied fantastic show to begin with  really hooks you in and it becomes essential to watch till the end as the show progresses however it does begin to get somewhat tiresome cliché and there are some really drawn out episodes towards the end that drag with some questionable writing my oh my goodness this season excited me and to be brutally honest first episode i didn’t have much clue to what it was about i hadn’t even watched a trailer for it and to be honest i don’t really like the name of the show squid game but the a old saying in life don’t judge a book by its cover and i guess that old saying rings true here ending was dragged out a bit and although they have made it very suggestive of a possible season  the fact it was dragged out this way has definitely decreased the ending scenes quality significantly however if it had not done this i could not see this advancing into a second season smoothly if at all absolutely amazing show i have never left a review on any show i’ve ever watched in my entire life but i recommend this show to everyone the plot is not predictable which i find very intriguing kudos to the creators because this show it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society not only does this show keep you hooked but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole with all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one i’ve seen to date there are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all i highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you it’s much needed perspective growth that more people should delve into this show is really amazing you can feel each characters emotions and feeling well the first half of this show make you feel various kind of feelings just like roller coaster is going on and then in the half its become heavy and tense last of the episodes are really heart wrenching  i mean i cant hold my tears it was to heavy well this show wont let you down in any aspects i haven’t watch any type of production so damn moving emotionally albeit this show is extremely emotionally and mentally draining it truly is personally moving and simply amazing work done by the writercreator production staff director and actors whom simply make this show one of the greatest film or movie i’ve ever laud witness to the character building alone is that of legendary status while each of the main casts actors are so perfectly cast and act their roles in ways i didn’t expect this isn’t just a korean hunger games by any means but more like a human case study on our nature and society as human beings this is a must watch for all adults as i’m sure young people will love the violence and story but adults will immediately relate with this show on so many levels i finished this series in  days it keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you cant stop watching one complaint i have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field  cough clickbait cough but squid game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective the acting and character development is so good you really feel for the characters which makes their demise that much more devastating this show is a must watch i binged this show and i loved it everyone i recommended this show to loved it great characters and a wellwritten story that makes you want more ive never left reviews before but squid game deserves it the acting is amazing even for the guards who you cant see their faces but they still hold a lot of emotion spoilers i loved rewatching it and finding all the hints i missed about the games on the wall or player  not being scanned during red light green light the characters were so well written and even relatable that it was truly sad to see them die spoilers over i highly recommend watching this show for yourself its truly amazing and grabs you from the start it made number  on netflix so it clearly did something right wow what an awesome series despite the fact that possible spoiler alert if it is  its easy to predict who will win since whoever is considered the main character almost always outlasts everyone everything else is just mindblowingly welldone you admire this show as an exquisite piece of art the soundtrack is fantastic really ominous and foreboding like the show setsprops are actually inspired by real works of art and incorporate things from real life allowing scenes to stick in your mind acting is topnotch everyone plays their part to their character story has a lot of depth too and little details that foreshadow events  things you come to realize only after youve finished the show  lets you appreciate how much thought has gone into making this show most importantly its a story thats resonating with a lot of people who are struggling to get by every day even with people who are welloff but feel the intense pressures of being in a competitive society we live in today its moving its powerful its beautiful watch it squid game is neatly written welldirected and one of the most vibrant show that i have ever come across in recent times the character development storyline and plot execution are jawdropping it really pushes you to think out of the box and questions your personal belief of humanity life relationship and most importantly how far an individual is willing to go for money even though if it requires the harshest of sacrifices this is the definition of a bingeworthy show havent seen a drama for a while the storys usually seem to get repetitive and quite predictable but not this one apart from the fact that it was obvious the protagonist would survive since the story revolved around him every episode was packed with twists at every turn really had me on up my toes it was so refreshing to watch a such a clever and wellthought out drama with some very thoughtprovoking life lessons  the cast needless to say made it all the more worth watching i am a korean drama addict but squid game really has the potential to get anyone hooked its that good i have never written a review for a show before but this one was so good that i honestly just had to especially since i finished the series in  days unlike alice in borderland which many claim to be similar to this show squid game truly makes you feel connected to the characters which ultimately makes their demise all the more heartbreaking the show is not as gory as some japanese counterparts but definitely does make you feel uneasyunsettled love how the show ties together childrens games and twists them into something far more sinister i truly hope to see a season  soon wow i was truly blown away by this amazing series every single thing about this show draws you in and it keeps you hooked i stayed up way later then i shouldve when having to go to work the next day just to keep watching the acting couldnt be better the idea is similar to others but this one is still so original at the same time it had a little bit of every genre in this to where i know anyone would end up liking this series ive really been enjoying a lot of the south korean series that netflix has been streaming lately i hope they keep it up and i will be so upset if this doesnt get a season  i finished this series in just  day it keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you cant stop watching one complaint i have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field  cough clickbait cough but squid game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective the acting and character development is so good you really feel for the characters which makes their demise that much more devastating it keeps you on the edge but i feel it is overrated  the old man is wise and it is nice to learn of the games korean people play we have same safe games in zimbabwe  however i think this is just an evil show  could be made better maybe dismis players who loose instead of killing them what does it teach one about soul i feel a human life is important and should not be toyed with yes the acting was good playout of the enitre story was good too everything was great except the story line it was an exact replica of hunger games we have seen it before this drama to me it illustrated the diminishing of human values and norms it depicts what really happens in our society regardless of where you at geographically  the rich seems to be above the law they get away with a lot of things  they prey on the poor what a sad society  so sad the movie is not that great it’s entertaining enough to watch i was so excited when i saw the trailer but the series is disappointing concept was really cool there were parts in there that were quite exciting  however didnt like the character development especially the end great start badly wrapped up entertaining great visuals the general idea of the story is a combination of famous movie clichés and horror seriesrnthe side stories of the series were practically incomplete and without context great concept and could have been brilliant but the character development and story telling are really bad very unrealistic scenarios shame perfect beautiful and lovely the first few episodes were fun to watch as they played out but as the series progressed a more serious ominous storyline starts to unfold due to viewers empatheticly connecting with a few of the characters facing uncertainty as the game continues even possible death i found the series in the overall really great refreshingly new and well planned out as it unfolded i hope that somehow the series will continue on into the future with many more seasons to come a great show from my perspective one of the most beautiful series ive ever seen finished in a few days one episode led to another and the desire to follow the series increases more and more the tension is built very well game by game and the main characters are really well developed squid game is definitely a slow burn in its first  episodes but they do give you a taste of whats to come as for the rest of the season you probably wont be able to stop watching thanks to its story characters thrills twists games and of course gore ive watched the whole lot and its just plain silly the cast bring overacting to a new level all the characters are spectacularly annoying i wanted them all to die by episode  and i dont know why i watched it all im sure there were far better things i could have been doing with my life like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails its really woeful squid game is a different type of show and im all for it i really liked watching this the hidden message seems to be about the crisis of debt in south korea and just how far some desperate people are willing to do for some cash i thought it was a very intense adventure that was followed such an entertaining craft this show has been made into i avoided the reviews upon watching instead i decided to give it a go and im glad i did as its very engaging to the point you cannot watch one episode this is definitely a bingeworthy one to catch as soon as possible before the internet ruins it for you i definitely recommend watching this some moments will have you laughing although others will have you the complete opposite it got me good on some parts in both ways check it out now on netflix believe the hype this is one of the best shows to ever hit netflix every episode gets better and better and the acting is spot on the action scenes are beautiful the whole concept is crazy but in this case crazy works i bought into the hype and watched this mess i am very confused about what people see in it i can look past the horrible over acting by the vo artists stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development i stuck it out until the end and was completely let down by far the worst finale of any series in history i really dont get the hype done  episodes now and find it all rather boring maybe i was expecting too much when someone told me it similar to battle royale i fail to see what got people so hyped about this it is slow veeeeryyy predictable characters not relatable at all long winded bathetic yes that is a word scenes borderline annoying characters no skill or smarts needed only luck very poorly written twists that fail to be twists and so on this is a huuuggeee disappointment the peer pressure made me watch this i wish this show came out about  years ago as some small part was predictable but was i surprised oh boyi definitely was dont need a second season but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies this was brilliant a number of excellent films have come out of south korea over the past decade or so now this a blinder of a tv series absolutely fantastic was thinking of cancelling netflix but glad i didnt fantastic show hoping there will be a season  really entertaining we were very roped in the whole time emotional at times check it out i watched episode  on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series and they were absolutely right i was captured right away the series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing beware cause there is more than enough violence in the series and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters at the same time that you despise others keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events you probably wont see them at first but they are cleverly thrown in often the best thing about this series is the acting my mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances there are true emmy or oscar level performances throughout the show one of the best series ive watched in a long time i wanted to like this i love asian film and tv from most of their countries and this entry started interesting enough but even some of the initial elements forbode what my instincts told me would be a lame ending thus maintaining the we dont care what we put out tradition of crappy netflix fare  hours to a horrible disappointing payoff it started to go off the rails and become a self righteous preachy mess around episode  i wont give away the ending but i warned you though im sure the lemmings who follow anything will applaud it bad acting and foolish composition i just cannot grasp why people rate this over  points really if it dosent take more than something like this to get great rating the quality perception has really deteriorated during the pandemic i seriously dont know what the hype is all about is it because people get killed while playing a game is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better to me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long started well but mid way through it gets tired and feels sluggish the games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc the ending was horrible and vagueit shows that losers will be losers even after winning just not relevant in todays world nothing more than a korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism democracy ethics etc terrible acting cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time this show has a great script excellent actors but fails to keep the viewers interested because it is really slow i often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer adding very little to the plot this show could easily have  episodes and that would improve a lot its entertaining value quickly became my favorite show of all time honestly i found it extraordinary one of the very few times ive found a show worthy of all the hype from the cinematography to the concept and everything in between but please watch it with subtitles it makes a huge difference i watched it dubbed the second time amd it takes so much away very entertaining and high in production quality but it suffered from some predictable writing and over the top acting issues it was obvious from the get go who was going to win and last the longest because those were characters that received the most development however some of the plot twists worked including the one at the end most episodes were well paced and a pleasure to watch thanks to lots of brutal action and decent dialogue but the episode when everybody left could have been better ill also say that the red hair ending and not getting on the plane was a bit weird and it was disappointing not hearing anything more about the police officer considering how op he was earlier on several characters were overdone acting and dialogue wise like the woman who struggled to find a team and the main character in places however there was a good mix of characters the acting was generally impressive and the extras did a good job then the cinematography setspropscostumes visual effects editing and soundtrack were all excellent for a tv show this show was terrible dont waste your time believe the hype truly awesome tv boring and predictable let s start saying that eastern culture is completely different from the westernsaid that i don t understand how this show is popular in europe us this is just the proof that people follow what is popular many asian might find this serie amazing but from a western guy point of view i have to say  acting was terrible a lot of overreaction for nothing read that dubbing was bad not at all that s how asians talk and behave if you didn t like the dubbing is because you don t like the style as different from your culture  everything in the movie was very predictable at least untill episode  then i stopped watching  extremely forced and pointless emotional scene build up on hypocrisy and very obvious cliches the idea itself was nothing new but good the rest rubbish i could like it if i was asian or maybe  years old without splatter scene this show is very overrated and overhyped its a unique concept but it feels very unoriginal with all that said it was very entertaining show that keeps the viewers engaged throughout most of it its very detailed and one of my favorite details is the main characters number with his number in the game being  it was a constant reminder of how many other players there were overall its worth a watch but goes over the top in the genre every once in a while i dont honestly understand the plot line or attraction to this show i dont know how anyone could not like this show im looking forward to netflixs future foreign offerings finally finished the writing was fairly obvious and very heavy handed but overall it was entertaining this was one of those shows where once it hooks you youre along for the ride and what a great ride it was three stars for a great first few episodes  star for not holding the quality till the end absolute loved this series hope theres a season  its good its not as big as the hype its not an original plot but its well written amazing characters the show made you worry about them ok its rather fun but also grossly overrated something is lacking here  were used to torture porn for the entertainment of rich people so no surprise here  the motivation of the puppet master is ridiculous and doesnt make sense from a psychological point of view so eventually if the show is entertaining and an easy critics of our capitalist system it doesnt really quench the thirst it gives you in the first place i watched it till the end but mainly out of curiosity the concept is interesting but predictable the acting is bad but the dynamics and the filming are good it gives a perspective of a world gone mad with many hopeless indebted poor being the willing participants in a capitalist game despite the heavy theme there is not much depth in the fim makers analysis of exploitation but its rather an excuse for violent entertainment this is one of the best things i have seen in a while it has a simple but interesting story line and has some emotional parts in this is a must see i loved the character development and the sets were great but i felt like the last episode was kind of boring and the ending didnt make much sense i didnt like the series it doesnt make any sense i would rather see a series with  or  seasons about the life of josé castelo branco too ridiculous series i dont understand how people like this dump absolutely incredible i watched the dubbed version and decided to rewatch the entire series in its original language with english subs if youre not into gore blood or violence its definitely not for you its fine worth your time legit emotional rollercoaster laughed and cried a must see this is an amazing korean drama this drama really show the true colors when one is desperate for money its good but too much character development that wasnt needed should have been ½ hour episodes instead of the hour long ones that most of them were im sorry but super overrated aside from the politics great watch the originality of the sets visuals and characters is entertaining and bingeworthy maybe a little predictable for those of us who have watched so many movies but recommended nevertheless absolutely brilliant great writing every damn actor did a great job the english dub is kind of charming its funny at times but i came to think of those voices as his or hers characters voice this is not some korean version of hunger games i found this infinitely more interesting and entertaining than hunger games it really is a must see its good but not that good to justify all the hype awesome bingwatched honestly i didnt know what to expect from this show things got fricken deep though i almost cried watching ali die he was my favorite character immediately this show has interesting story telling to keep viewers engaged characters to love and characters to hate tear jerking moments character development and deep themes not for the faint of heart but still a great show'"

              "'i know korea is still a mysoginistic society until now because there government doesnt want women to have power and more equal rights than men and thats the sad truth of the society but judging the story it felt flat for me the beginning episodes are great but after episode  it felt draggy and slow and i get the betrayal of friends part but i think it feels so injustice of the other characters especially ali they didi him dirty and still koreans always look down dark or brown skinned people i hate it here and still racist to foreigners ngl though and the ending is still open ended so weed a nd season to answer all the several plotholes of previous episodes acting is phenomenal hands down especially saebyeok i love her role in this its giving me katnis everdeen vibes heheheh purr and gihun too i love his kind honest protagonist and especially the front man i love villainess of the characters high budget production outfits stages evrything felt flat for the ost i need lisas money fpr the ost of the nd season please it matches the series thats all yall should watch alice in borderland it has better plot than the squid game purr the show was amazing the way i was crying for characters i have only known them for  episodes is just crazy cause this is the first time it has happened to me the way they have developed the characters even if we dont know that much about their background other than gihun but honestly they never tell us anything like why he debt or any other information so its crazy how i started crying this also just proves how the acting is just amazing and i loved the cast and they fit so well with the roles and the chemistry with each other was amazing too also i was so happy seeing a south asian character because its not very common to see them and even if you do see them they are small roles no main characters so i was very very happy about that me being an indian myself the music was also so good the song matched the vibe so well such as when they played happy songs in bad situations it really matched well with the childrens game theme or the pink soldiers song gave such an eerie vibe but i kept wanting to listen to the song even though it kinda freaked me out a little lastly i loved the story so much but if im going to be honest the story was pretty basic but it was still so addicting and i binged the whole show in one sitting so i still totally reccomed watching i love this show so much and im so happy for the show and the actors for all the international attention this show is getting and other kdramas suddenly getting after squid game like the stories are so good they deserve it yayyyy squid game was truly something else i expected a bunch of games but did i expect everything that happened during and after the games no definitely not this obviously needs a season  since the ending was kind of crappy dont get me wrong the beginning and the show in general was excellent however i wish the ending was a little more developed seong gi hoon was an interesting character he was naïve of a sort even though he was been through a lot even after what happened at the end he continued to live his life the way it was before cho sang woo honestly did not deserve to last so long in the games this man was dangerous and we couldnt even detect it kang sae byeok was the best character hands down she faced everything headon which is something i want to do whenever im in the middle of a situation hwang jun ho was pretty irrelevant in my opinion because his purpose was to only find his brother who went missing the hot thing about him was that he always used the words of someone whenever he was violated theres no closure about him which i wish did happen hopefully in season  well get closure about him ali was too innocent in this drama all he wanted was money for his wife and kid poor guy couldnt even get anything but he left his family a good amount oh il nami dont know i have a confusing view about him he treated the guys so nice but at the end what he explained was messed up ji yeong was also badass her ending is undeserved she deserved a second chance theres a bunch of other characters i would have reviewed but meh its whatever lol its competent in most aspects the hype honestly makes it a worse experience because you expect something mindblowing and genre breaking its not that its battle royale fall guys its mostly enjoyable the social commentary is a bit heavy handed at times but its nice to have it there its not that original its not perfect its fine  random note the scenes with english speaking foreigners were hilarious the writing was mostly ok but it didnt come off as entirely natural and combined with notstellar acting it felt odd i guess like asian scenes feel in western movies maybe yeah worth the hype i wasnt wowed by the first episode of this drama nor entirely enchanted by the second but by the end of the second episode i thought dang okay fine i guess i want to keep watching and im glad i did the most thrilling and emotional parts of this show took place within the game itself the games are simple childrens games but are games that dont necessarily require skill most of the time its luck which number you drew which shape you got that sort of thing the game purports to be fair but its only fair in the way that real life is fair youre stuck with the cards youve been given the poor characters take part in the game because the real world is so terrible for them that the game is the best alternative theyve got sadly some even think they can win despite as weve discussed the games being largely luckbased the characters are mostly pretty decent in this the main character gi hoon is initially kind of a piece of trash but you realize that hes a gambling addict and this leads to him hurting the people he loves hes not an inherently bad person who wants to hurt others and you see that come out in the game where hes one of the kinder people there the rest of the cast are also great not a weak performance in sight id say the cops plotline and character are mildly confusing and vague and youre just not that emotionally invested in it compared to everyone else the show continues to get better and better as the games keep going and people dienpeople die in very emotionally impacting ways and i think they did all the character deaths very well they often feel different too whether its because it was accidental somebody cheated so they lost or just bad luck and the deaths can weirdly almost feel like a part of their character arcs i dont know how the writers pulled it off but they did it well tldr its really worth watching because its not just trashy fun it has so much to say about the unfairness of the systems in this world that keep poor people down im not sure id rewatch it because its so emotionally overwhelming at times but it is super good average for its genre  dont get me wrong this is a pretty decent show but at the same time the ending didnt satisfied me at all it ended like this in order to have more seasons ofc but idk for me it lacked smt survival movies or tv shows are never a concept i find revolutionary so i think its pretty funny how of all the kdramas out there this one is the most watched on netflix not only that but its the top most watched shows on netlix of all time i understand everything and all that but if i ever survived such a crazy hell i would either end up killing myself regardless or just really living and doing everything ive ever wanted might as well whats the worst that can happen i watched this on the spur of the moment after having  intention of watching it previously because tbh how many times have mangaanime fans seen this survival game concept growing up with japanese entertainment nothing about this show was new at all but i still loved it i suppose for westerners it might be new but for me the shock factors or disturbing qualities didnt stand out from originality but from the pure execution i could say the majority of the plot turns were predictable as well but the pacing and performances were so good that it kept me on the edge of my seat the violencegore wasnt emotionally or mentally straining and was easy to get to used to after the initial shocks of the first two episodes i loved the detective passionately d and not just because that man is incredibly fine but his character addition really added to the quick pacing of the show mixing in another storyline so as to almost give us a breather from the dirty inhumane warehouse feeling the other characters endured i believe that the alternations of characterstory focuses was what was really done well because it always kept you rolling and focused a next next next action experience the only reason im not giving it a  is because i really felt that the ending of some characters was rushed episode  definitely lacked the full emotional appeal of loss for me and i was mildly disappointed but i understand there was a time crunch ive never stayed up all night to watch a show before but i did for squid game i was absolutely groggy the next day but it was worth it im currently rewatching it with my mom and it is still an incredibly crisp viewing the camerawork and colors were executed very very well and i look forward to watching hwang dong hyuks other works the novelty of squid game thats all over media is  western hype in my opinion but tbh with how well done this show was it probably deserves it i wasnt sure at first that this would be for me im usually more of a romance based story lover but this really surprised me squid game has no romance and i wasnt bothered in the least about it i was just an interesting story with morally grey compelling characters im a bit confused about the ending im not sure if they did it that way so that there could possibly be another season or just to make the viewer think but overall this kept me very engaged and i really liked it a lot if the creators were to do another show set in this world i would love to see more about how it started how the workers are chosen and just more about the frontman the frontman had the potential to be a really interesting character the story just wasnt focusing on him i just want to know why he chose to join the game maybe even spoilers see what his original game was like and ultimately led him to abandon his family and become a major part of the game a brilliant show fully worth watching this is a show that is simultaneously brutal and beautiful in its depiction and execution its a fantastic metaphor for capitalism and the illusion of autonomy the compulsion to survive that drives the poorest when their supposed freedoms and choices are constrained by a need to survive anyone could have left the game but out in the real world the pressures would not let them so they stayed and played  i thought gihun was a weak and unsympathetic character i didnt like the actors constipated expressions at everything and i thought the support cast was better in terms of sympathetic characters and acting the plot itself was formulaic but still great lot of the deaths were foreshadowed but that often made the prelude thick with emotional suspense and a desperation to be proven wrong the games were brutal and i thought in particular that episodes  and  were masterful again i felt let down by the main character and i also found everything on the side with the undercover policeman to be an unnecessary addition which could instead have been devoted to fleshing out the back stories of some of the other characters i found the north korean defector sorry i cant remember her name the most interesting whilst ali and the old man were the most endearing this show really though could only be endured if you hated the characters as soon as you began liking someone they were bound to die copied storyline with a weird ending and way too much blood i watched this because everyone keeeps talking about this seriespostitive points very good production high quality the actors gave a great performance really cant say anything bad about that negative points the whole story is just well it reminds me a lot of alice in borderland expect that alice in borderland was a lot better in my opinion the ending of squid game is kinda predictable and not satisfying at all there isnt really a happy ending for anyone tbh i dont get the hype there are way better korean asian series out there still i think its cool that people start recognizing korean  asian series movies more  if you like blood gore and mind fck this series is for you if you dont better watch something else squid game is one of the most exciting series to hit netflix in some time it mashes up the carefree idyllic days of childhood with the brutal realism of adulthood as it forces everyday people to compete in life or death matches in a bid to potentially wipe out their debts equal parts gutwrenching and squirminducing it’s a whiteknuckle thriller drama and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer it’s one of the most unique things you’ll watch this year  and maybe ever show was lame very weirdly paced and slow it wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee dont follow the hype either idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense you dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show this show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as br skip this or watch if your bored the fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews including the established critics celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the st century so much is wrong with this series yes the whole idea behind it that i hardly know where to start but ill try the purely cinematic criticism first the character development is ad hoc in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible the character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script the supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else scattered in to show humanity friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there they are ultimately not figures in themselves the cinematography is okay but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic which is so full of wealth greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such antivalues but their celebration the music  the score are completely irrelevant and immature they have no influence on the film the script has as many gaps as a swiss cheese and storylines go untold the actors are sometimes like that but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory they often only convey one and when the going gets tough maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings aside from these obvious aspects however the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hideandseek the producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth unscrupulousness greed for money and in the ultimate end a moral story about ethics humanity and humanism but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath interested in topics instead the show should and will be driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance the last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively a game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here artistic love for the medium of film or an affection for pop culture none of it i have a hard time expressing how much i hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away our world like ancient rome seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time have fun and welcome to the squid games im out starts off pretty well in the first episode then its just downhill and pointless the ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crap it turns out everything is dread nothing has any meaning and no one gets happy for anything doom gloom and bad acting is all you get after now over  unhelpfuls here we go again guys i dont know what to say squid game is not a good show its garbage i hope there wont be a season  a spin off or a movie watch the first episode if you cant resist the marketing hype youll see its a  but since these few points  due to the fresh storyline  are undeserved its heavily inspired by the mangaanime kaiji and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies ill give it a  abysmal overacting puppet characters unrealistic and unrefined stuff even teens which are the main target once the novelty factor fades will recognize that its trash sadly and stupidly i watched every episode  easily predictable on what happens and whos who the acting is woeful with even worse dubbing if i can remember who recommended this to me id throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting  hours of my life on utter dross its not unique its not different its all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surprise if i can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done  could not relate to the story or any of the characters just didnt even care who lives who dies loopholes in the story galore unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter in the end was like yawn whatever no issues with gore in movies seen plenty in others but the storyactingscreenplay should hold and carry the movie through this felt like it is riding on the wave movies like parasite created for korean cinematv bloated overhyped nonsense at best give it a skip and save your time could barely get through the first  mins of this extremely boring cheesy unstimulating i kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on a lot of over acting i do not understand what the hype is all about this is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games dont want just waste of time only a sociopath will like watching something like this the show has very negative energy and it affects the audience if you dont realise that im sorry for you i love thrillers and horror movies if they have a point in them this is too much because there are literally so many people living in debt especially now during covid and the suicide rates have skyrocketed because of it this is not funny nor interesting nor enjoyable to watch therefore i vote it in the gutter because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it the talk and reviews have me bewildered im only up to ep but am struggling after about  attempts to start bingeing i find it boring and really childish with pretty ordinary acting the set design art direction and general production values are very s two more attempts then ill give up its really not that good highly predictable and the ending was terrible i will say though the main character and his acting wasnt too bad enjoyed watching him but other than that its a waste of time anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series let me preface no i am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it i have seen many horrorthrillers including the death game genre so while i thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones i cant wrap my head around the hype many people bring up how it is similar to x game book movie etc so im thinking netflix created a way for casual and nonhorror viewers to get exposure to it thinking its new or innovating complaints about that aside the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainmentwise for me it is watchable for sure but certain characters mainly the cop are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or rewritten also annoying is yes the vips act horribly and yes everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being theres only one winner in summary was it good depends on personal taste was it genius unique or without flaws absolutely not i didnt enjoy it enough to binge but it made for a decent casual viewing id suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be first off the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in takashi miikes kamisama no iu tôri it almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director  second i mostly have experience with south korean horror movies and ive always thought that south korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted japanese and chinese but the acting in squid game definitely feels more theatrical which is not a good thing imo its hard to connect with the story and the actors when theyre expressing every emotion with shouting flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces this might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in asia but i prefer the realistic kind the show was decent worth watching but not as great as some are saying took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing get ready for season  you know not that bad considering overhype ephemera no more but has a good picture music and lets say not so banal development of events of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer but for most series and viewers lets say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement usually it is so strongest side of this series is an acting it is really solid i think considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as  a hype is a hype is a hype and our actual societys zeitgeist the series is far away from the mentioned masterpiece its starts very good the first  parts are very enjoyable but then it goes down quite quickly everything is far too obvious from the beginning everything is so clear not one single surprise to the end and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline the bad dialogues and the overacting furthermore full of plotholes another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes all in all nothing special how is this currently on a score of  the lead character was so annoying in the first  minutes that i switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through its not a patch on either battle royale or the american version of that hunger games it drags on and on and on and the ending is just flat watch it if you must because of the bingehype value but it has little to offer any serious film buff good idea for a show but poor execution of it totally overrated but then i saw the american actors that play a role and i knew that all the acting was really bad starts off shocking and kinda intriguing and fades into being dumb and boring had a hard time paying attention by the end good theme but story developed in a bad way poor direction idle for hr movie release than that of an episode series i loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe a great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of moneyapparently  mil american they must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing like the sopranos with some of the episodes better than others number six was the best for me the sets are wes anderson like with bright colors filling the screen the lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written the violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight the final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall i was highly entertained i genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end a true social commentary on humanity competition and avarice when the carnage is occurring its nailbiting and between the games you get compelling human drama  a fantastic addition to the kill game genre that seems to always be elevated by korean talent behind and in front of the camera this is an entertaining series from south korea that embodies elements of korean soap opera chinese operatic acting and japanese theater it uses classical chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and angerand a lot of shouting it uses hunger games as its base and survival of the fittest as its main theme the story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode  it then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode it is set up for a second season if one can judge from the final episode but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven have to agree with the other comments about the group of actors playing the vips they obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all enjoyable for what its meant to be a tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to for those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series basically the series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that youll definitely notice and say when youre watching that character is me  it is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end the same money that come from the blood and sweat of others the capitalist system claims that there is equity and justice in the distribution of the wealth and this is far from the truth as for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process money is no longer their pleasure that they only find pleasure in people suffer when he finally wins some moneyonly to lose it  seconds later i turned it off and didnt come back for a while but eventually i did and it is pretty good of course it drags  minute episodes into  hour long episodesbut its still good both twists were so predictable the police brother and the old man were so obviousand what is the message of the showbeing rich is just awfullol korea must have lots of poor people squid game is a great tv show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money the tv show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money i enjoyed the tv show it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes some mysteries also and some big revelations i enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch i will recommend anyone to watch this tv show it was quite good perfect to binge watching this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments while not really perfect this is a perfectly fine netflix entertainment totally recommended its different but the same basically a different take on the violent game shows were nobody really wins episode  was the best episode if theres a season two it needs to be the revenge if you enjoy korean movies then this is a must see has become a real hit cool idea interesting games and drama plenty of story to continue more seasons  ive got final  eps left but have really enjoyed up to this point typical korean ott actionand some real life back stories thrown in for good measure was good to see a non korean ali abdul in this thoroughly entertaining and a great distraction from all the madness in the world this tv show is very good to me something different from what we are used to watch for me is very original this is the first korean drama ive watched while i was absolutely blown away there were a couple of moments where i thought the story dragged a little however it was all added for tension im sure it was absolutely stunning to look at and really well done i cant wait to see what happens in the next series great show korean drama that is perceivable for n american audience similar story attempts have been made in the past but this one has a great blend of drama with a little unpleasantries wow no show has ever stressed me out as much as this one it was seriously insane and crazy and hilarious all at once kept me on the edge of my seat thats for sure it had me laughing and crying and terrified well directed pretty good writing uneven acting partly over the top theatrical partly just as it should be well produced and shot keeps viewers attention slightly predictable at moments and in general masterfully edited and with an appropriate music score as the tile says good watch but only once since then youll know the secret and the mystery will be gone forever really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin started very strong up until episode  then went downhill with all the vip stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on has great production values and acting episode  was the best one by a mile but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how season  will turn out this was a generally ok show very typical of an anime series just another game show game where people fight it out to the death some sets were stupid like the arcade machines that could wipe surveillance footage of people in a hallway magically with one random arcade button none of that typey typey break the code and delete just okay this button should probably be preprogramed to erase evidence of stuff  ended up not even being a part of the end story plot yo hello anyone listening no answers on the harvest body parts just the you can sell them or eat them i dont care but part then boom that entire plot is gone seriously i have picked apart this entire series and its just absolutely a typical live action anime bad dub and all i cant tell if the actors sucked of if it was the voice over actors  first episodes drew me in as something new but series left me feeling like i just watched another dumb anime not an exciting drama with original characters this show revealed a lot to me about how people stereotype the rest of the world based on racist stereotypes is all media propaganda in some way or another in the first  episodes there was a sense of potential in the series but as it progresses it felt like the scriptwriters are just adding cliches not something i would expect from a korean drama i expected it to be unique not your usual survivalthemed series and you know the type that gets you thinking everything about this screams american storyline predictability acting character development if there is any and concept it was lackluster and i honestly was cringing just wishing it to be over i predicted almost everything except gong yoo’s role the casts are great starstudded even but when those foreigners started acting i had the hardest cringe of my life they made a bad series even worse i’m not ecstatic for a season  but i can already smell a possible storyline not to mention lee byunghun’s brother who i presumed to be alive because the gunshot is not fatal i’ll give season  the benefit of the doubt but i’m really sorry coz this season is not worth my time probably the most horrible acting i have ever seen the writers of this probably wear goat masks and blow eachother just like in the show the storyline is so bad that i think netflix should start recruiting people in grade  if they don’t already by the way that idea is patent pending lol i think i will run a series where netflix employees are given certain castings then imprisoned to play games to the death that is yet another great idea just within a review cheers compelling visually intriguing exciting fast paced and innovative it has all the right credentials apart from the inane and unnecessary violence i don’t give a jot for all the reviews that say it’s a clever commentary on society today it is not it is a show that does nothing other than glorify death for no reason whatsoever any clever commentary could have been communicated without the need for death and worse the volume of people who are raving about it what does that say about our society that so many are utterly unaffected by such gratuitous murder  that it’s justifiable that their lives were of no value and expendable just because they were financially ruined i didn’t get what moral this show was trying to teach me but surely there has to be some deeper truth to justify such macabre storytelling i watched one episode and that was enough shame on you netflix for peddling such brutality one of the worst shows of the genre the one star given is for aesthetics but other than that the series delivers nothing more than a combination of ideas from other survival game dramas and movies besides the dramatic acting approach and impressive setting the series failed to deliver its messaging despite wanting to appear deep and introspective mildly annoyed by how many perceive this show to be more clever and introspective than it is  many aspects are not explained well or there’s really no meaning behind them at all not a fan of whole killing spree but the series was off to a good start with recruiting and with games but major bummer was the end wth was that ending throughout the series it was conveyed to the audience the  is a good man except in marble game and then he just idling with his life for one whole year without fulfilling the promises he made for the last  dying ones in the game when he had billions in his account ending was pathetic to the point make me feel it was such a waste of time watching all that there are unwanted scenarios in the series the idea of story is genius smart but sorry to say i dont like this film because to many provide sadistic violence inhuman many students of my country talking and interesting about this movie although their age are  not enough and not allowed to see the movie hope if this film will be released in  seriescould you please make it with softly  because your movie inspired many peoplethank you and success for your team i left the first episode with pain in my chest…literally this show is not smart not entertaining and an unfortunate representation of what we are expected to believe that money and hate overrule humanity netflix does not fail in releasing one show after the other that depict the big lie that humanity knows nothing but hate jealousy betrayal anger and filth the truth is that humanity is capable of so much love but we will never see that on yet another mass propaganda channel please spend your time spreading the right messages serving the world to be a better place and indulging in good smart and uplifting content…not this the filming and pace is okay but most characters are inconsequential and lackluster theres no real meaningful character development in this series many promising characters starting out but most ended up being just plot devices to get the story moving virtually nothing will change if you swap some of the main characters out games are also extremely bland compared to similar pieces like liar game or alice in borderland considering there are without giving spoilers quite a few a games and they take up significant amount of the screen time the fact that there are almost no clever design to these games and how they play out is very disappointing it is an okay series as pastime however if you compare it to any serious predecessor in the genre this one is quite pale in comparison especially at its core if you like watching people get killed while playing children games for money at any cost to win or gamble wtheir life to get out of a financial  crisis then this is your  netflix tv series movie  i found it to be downright disturbing considering the world we live in today it definitely fits into the grand scheme of things during this pandemic what people will do for money especially when you are forced to make that decision it shows who has morals or not  in conclusion definitely not my cup of tea but maybe someone elses flavor but the story suffers in the ending the reaction of the protagonist became abnormal to the point of him trying to kill a dying man on his deathbed can he be a little compassionate like when he wanted to just stop the last game because he suddenly grew a conscience talking slowly when he saw his mother lying on the floor the normal reaction is to call for help immediately and him living like a beggar for a year not using his winnings the ending would have been better when the last part was the scene from the atm showing the whooping amount he earned the main character is boring and relies on luck too much the sets are creative but the characters have such basic and cookie cutter arcs not to mention the parts with the doctor player were extremely boring and many unnecessary scenes were added the reveal at the end and the purpose of the squid game didn’t really have an effect for me it led to sort of a “so what” conclusion a good show to kill time if you’ve got not much else to watch made it through most of episode  before bailing  no sympathy for selfinflicted losers sob stories and no interest in seeing the suffering they cause others  the girl or the mother were the only redeeming characters and watching them suffer offers no joy  dont care what happens to deranged gamblers so why watch  the acting is melodramatic caricatures more cartoonish than appealing and the concept is just absurd the production values are high so  stars for that just personal opinion the whole drama is vibrant all actors performance is awesome bringing the drama to a different level its a good show but very sexist towards women it showing young kids that men are stronger than women its disgusting it will make girls feel like they cant grow up to stand up for themselves they make women seem less than overall should empower women more as their are a lot of women out their who work their but off to fight and be strong overall good show also is this off how korea treats those who are poor should have made women to be seen as more confident and stronger the premise itself is good and the first few episodes are wellexecuted but theres a bit of a cultural clash regarding some of the tropes and the characters mindsets when presented to a western audience egalitarianism between the sexes isnt as progressed in korea so the repeated emphasis on the female players being weaker undesirable teammates was pretty grating the ending was very disappointing after such a large amount of character development i expected better you do get to grow fond of characters and there are many anticipated plot twists some points in the storyline seemed like they were tied off hastily somethings were left with lackluster if any answers not sure if it’s a ploy to lead up to a second season but i found myself literally angry at the end for a character’s entire motive to just be abandoned at the last minute is just irritating redemption was available many times over for the main character just to be fumbled and squandered production was gorgeous though the vips would be more tolerable without any lines as they remained anonymous and got away ultimately nothing would have been missed i binged it the entire day and it was good but i didnt like the ending too but the acting was amazing plus the set it’s wacky… it’s sappy… it goes from slapstick zany to blood splattering gruesome… and emotionally fluctuates with really extreme characterssituations it’s kind of all over the place in my opinion it was ok there were some characterizations and stereotypes that i found slightly offensive and there were some elements that were so illogical it completely pulled my focus out of the main actions when a group of certain special people arrive i think it gets kind of dumb the colors and aesthetics of the costumeset design are stunning but i think some of the masks are just way over the top  i love mask i’ve made masks and often wear large obnoxious masks at halloween parties i know how cumbersome and uncomfortable they can get there’s no way some of the characters in the show would be wearing those gaudy hot heavy masks all the time that said the characters are mostly engaging and story is bizarre enough to keep one watching till the end a lot of people that is new to the genre might find this show entertaining personally i enjoyed some parts of this show but most of the time  i find myself questioning the simplicity of the games itself the shallow plotline building up moral compasses that leads to nowhere and disappointing character developments yeah i am talking about the main character he is as selfish as he was during the first episode and the last episode this is the first time i am putting my review for any tv series squid game is definitely an engaging and intriguing series and a binge watch for all the twist in the end was great as i never saw that coming and the ending of the first season tells us that a second season is om its way soon this series is very interesting and definitely keeps you wanting to watch more just because the events happening in the show but honestly i had to watch the show in incriminates because if i watched too much at once i’d get sick to my stomach because this show is pretty gruesome it shows pretty rough things and honestly makes you think how it’s rated  on netflix right now personally i think no one under the age  should watch this series because of the events that happen anyone with trauma i don’t think should watch this either because of the scenes i don’t want to ruin anything for anyone who reads this but warning to all its gruesome i would like to write an honest review im not going to write what people seeing on internet about show truth is it was a good series no doubt acting skills are so damn good but it obviously bored you in last  episodes where there is need of adreline rush obviously episode    are best in the entire series i would like to suggest you people do not follow the hype created about the show on social network media there are other series and movie better than that but didnt get praised all those hype they had created on social media is paid n one mormost important thing i fall sleep watching this show twice now you can conclude on your own the first few episodes were captivating mostly for the shock factor but unfortunately i think it fell off entirely after episode six which is meant to be very sad but how can we feel that sad for anyone when we have become so desensitised to people dying already there were a few should we just skip moments in the last two episodes due to the drag after finishing the show i felt a little unsatisfied overall it was a well produced show and showcased some brilliant acting even if the story falls off at the end still worth a watch the only negative point of this series is its too slow plus many of the scenes are streched very unnecessarily for eg in last episode theres a two way communication and it is been streched continuously for half and hours and its damn boring i dont know what the makers were thinking they might have thought that yes were creating great suspense but no youre making the audience feel bore the positive things are the sets and performance every actor just killed it in their role also the sets were designed very beautifully for the task the show has some really brilliant scenes but in the end comes to a predictable and tame ending the ending couldve been so much more i would say a good watch for creative and concept value as well as the performances by the entire cast not a bad series but highly overated in my opinion the story is old but the acting is superb cruelty is similar to saw and tarantino a lot of moral dilemmas arise as the show progresses the uniforms and the playground songs are well placed not recommended for anyone under  it can be rough for audiences that dont like death games movies it is disturbing gross and insane the show isnt binge worthy if youre easily triggered by violence deep down it is a lesson how nostalgia  the urge to make money can actually kill you the series had a motive of showing the people that they are actually different kinds of animals in the world but there is a difference animals dont think  alternatively humans do they are very ugly inside actually we dont have feelings at all we use it for our own advantage humans always  consider for their selves  first  and then their loved ones this series will give you how people are seen in different situations when they are placed money will buy you everything but we  humans are never ever satisfied fantastic show to begin with  really hooks you in and it becomes essential to watch till the end as the show progresses however it does begin to get somewhat tiresome cliché and there are some really drawn out episodes towards the end that drag with some questionable writing my oh my goodness this season excited me and to be brutally honest first episode i didn’t have much clue to what it was about i hadn’t even watched a trailer for it and to be honest i don’t really like the name of the show squid game but the a old saying in life don’t judge a book by its cover and i guess that old saying rings true here ending was dragged out a bit and although they have made it very suggestive of a possible season  the fact it was dragged out this way has definitely decreased the ending scenes quality significantly however if it had not done this i could not see this advancing into a second season smoothly if at all absolutely amazing show i have never left a review on any show i’ve ever watched in my entire life but i recommend this show to everyone the plot is not predictable which i find very intriguing kudos to the creators because this show it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society not only does this show keep you hooked but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole with all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one i’ve seen to date there are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all i highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you it’s much needed perspective growth that more people should delve into this show is really amazing you can feel each characters emotions and feeling well the first half of this show make you feel various kind of feelings just like roller coaster is going on and then in the half its become heavy and tense last of the episodes are really heart wrenching  i mean i cant hold my tears it was to heavy well this show wont let you down in any aspects i haven’t watch any type of production so damn moving emotionally albeit this show is extremely emotionally and mentally draining it truly is personally moving and simply amazing work done by the writercreator production staff director and actors whom simply make this show one of the greatest film or movie i’ve ever laud witness to the character building alone is that of legendary status while each of the main casts actors are so perfectly cast and act their roles in ways i didn’t expect this isn’t just a korean hunger games by any means but more like a human case study on our nature and society as human beings this is a must watch for all adults as i’m sure young people will love the violence and story but adults will immediately relate with this show on so many levels i finished this series in  days it keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you cant stop watching one complaint i have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field  cough clickbait cough but squid game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective the acting and character development is so good you really feel for the characters which makes their demise that much more devastating this show is a must watch i binged this show and i loved it everyone i recommended this show to loved it great characters and a wellwritten story that makes you want more ive never left reviews before but squid game deserves it the acting is amazing even for the guards who you cant see their faces but they still hold a lot of emotion spoilers i loved rewatching it and finding all the hints i missed about the games on the wall or player  not being scanned during red light green light the characters were so well written and even relatable that it was truly sad to see them die spoilers over i highly recommend watching this show for yourself its truly amazing and grabs you from the start it made number  on netflix so it clearly did something right wow what an awesome series despite the fact that possible spoiler alert if it is  its easy to predict who will win since whoever is considered the main character almost always outlasts everyone everything else is just mindblowingly welldone you admire this show as an exquisite piece of art the soundtrack is fantastic really ominous and foreboding like the show setsprops are actually inspired by real works of art and incorporate things from real life allowing scenes to stick in your mind acting is topnotch everyone plays their part to their character story has a lot of depth too and little details that foreshadow events  things you come to realize only after youve finished the show  lets you appreciate how much thought has gone into making this show most importantly its a story thats resonating with a lot of people who are struggling to get by every day even with people who are welloff but feel the intense pressures of being in a competitive society we live in today its moving its powerful its beautiful watch it squid game is neatly written welldirected and one of the most vibrant show that i have ever come across in recent times the character development storyline and plot execution are jawdropping it really pushes you to think out of the box and questions your personal belief of humanity life relationship and most importantly how far an individual is willing to go for money even though if it requires the harshest of sacrifices this is the definition of a bingeworthy show havent seen a drama for a while the storys usually seem to get repetitive and quite predictable but not this one apart from the fact that it was obvious the protagonist would survive since the story revolved around him every episode was packed with twists at every turn really had me on up my toes it was so refreshing to watch a such a clever and wellthought out drama with some very thoughtprovoking life lessons  the cast needless to say made it all the more worth watching i am a korean drama addict but squid game really has the potential to get anyone hooked its that good i have never written a review for a show before but this one was so good that i honestly just had to especially since i finished the series in  days unlike alice in borderland which many claim to be similar to this show squid game truly makes you feel connected to the characters which ultimately makes their demise all the more heartbreaking the show is not as gory as some japanese counterparts but definitely does make you feel uneasyunsettled love how the show ties together childrens games and twists them into something far more sinister i truly hope to see a season  soon wow i was truly blown away by this amazing series every single thing about this show draws you in and it keeps you hooked i stayed up way later then i shouldve when having to go to work the next day just to keep watching the acting couldnt be better the idea is similar to others but this one is still so original at the same time it had a little bit of every genre in this to where i know anyone would end up liking this series ive really been enjoying a lot of the south korean series that netflix has been streaming lately i hope they keep it up and i will be so upset if this doesnt get a season  i finished this series in just  day it keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you cant stop watching one complaint i have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field  cough clickbait cough but squid game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective the acting and character development is so good you really feel for the characters which makes their demise that much more devastating it keeps you on the edge but i feel it is overrated  the old man is wise and it is nice to learn of the games korean people play we have same safe games in zimbabwe  however i think this is just an evil show  could be made better maybe dismis players who loose instead of killing them what does it teach one about soul i feel a human life is important and should not be toyed with yes the acting was good playout of the enitre story was good too everything was great except the story line it was an exact replica of hunger games we have seen it before this drama to me it illustrated the diminishing of human values and norms it depicts what really happens in our society regardless of where you at geographically  the rich seems to be above the law they get away with a lot of things  they prey on the poor what a sad society  so sad the movie is not that great it’s entertaining enough to watch i was so excited when i saw the trailer but the series is disappointing concept was really cool there were parts in there that were quite exciting  however didnt like the character development especially the end great start badly wrapped up entertaining great visuals the general idea of the story is a combination of famous movie clichés and horror seriesrnthe side stories of the series were practically incomplete and without context great concept and could have been brilliant but the character development and story telling are really bad very unrealistic scenarios shame perfect beautiful and lovely the first few episodes were fun to watch as they played out but as the series progressed a more serious ominous storyline starts to unfold due to viewers empatheticly connecting with a few of the characters facing uncertainty as the game continues even possible death i found the series in the overall really great refreshingly new and well planned out as it unfolded i hope that somehow the series will continue on into the future with many more seasons to come a great show from my perspective one of the most beautiful series ive ever seen finished in a few days one episode led to another and the desire to follow the series increases more and more the tension is built very well game by game and the main characters are really well developed squid game is definitely a slow burn in its first  episodes but they do give you a taste of whats to come as for the rest of the season you probably wont be able to stop watching thanks to its story characters thrills twists games and of course gore ive watched the whole lot and its just plain silly the cast bring overacting to a new level all the characters are spectacularly annoying i wanted them all to die by episode  and i dont know why i watched it all im sure there were far better things i could have been doing with my life like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails its really woeful squid game is a different type of show and im all for it i really liked watching this the hidden message seems to be about the crisis of debt in south korea and just how far some desperate people are willing to do for some cash i thought it was a very intense adventure that was followed such an entertaining craft this show has been made into i avoided the reviews upon watching instead i decided to give it a go and im glad i did as its very engaging to the point you cannot watch one episode this is definitely a bingeworthy one to catch as soon as possible before the internet ruins it for you i definitely recommend watching this some moments will have you laughing although others will have you the complete opposite it got me good on some parts in both ways check it out now on netflix believe the hype this is one of the best shows to ever hit netflix every episode gets better and better and the acting is spot on the action scenes are beautiful the whole concept is crazy but in this case crazy works i bought into the hype and watched this mess i am very confused about what people see in it i can look past the horrible over acting by the vo artists stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development i stuck it out until the end and was completely let down by far the worst finale of any series in history i really dont get the hype done  episodes now and find it all rather boring maybe i was expecting too much when someone told me it similar to battle royale i fail to see what got people so hyped about this it is slow veeeeryyy predictable characters not relatable at all long winded bathetic yes that is a word scenes borderline annoying characters no skill or smarts needed only luck very poorly written twists that fail to be twists and so on this is a huuuggeee disappointment the peer pressure made me watch this i wish this show came out about  years ago as some small part was predictable but was i surprised oh boyi definitely was dont need a second season but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies this was brilliant a number of excellent films have come out of south korea over the past decade or so now this a blinder of a tv series absolutely fantastic was thinking of cancelling netflix but glad i didnt fantastic show hoping there will be a season  really entertaining we were very roped in the whole time emotional at times check it out i watched episode  on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series and they were absolutely right i was captured right away the series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing beware cause there is more than enough violence in the series and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters at the same time that you despise others keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events you probably wont see them at first but they are cleverly thrown in often the best thing about this series is the acting my mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances there are true emmy or oscar level performances throughout the show one of the best series ive watched in a long time i wanted to like this i love asian film and tv from most of their countries and this entry started interesting enough but even some of the initial elements forbode what my instincts told me would be a lame ending thus maintaining the we dont care what we put out tradition of crappy netflix fare  hours to a horrible disappointing payoff it started to go off the rails and become a self righteous preachy mess around episode  i wont give away the ending but i warned you though im sure the lemmings who follow anything will applaud it bad acting and foolish composition i just cannot grasp why people rate this over  points really if it dosent take more than something like this to get great rating the quality perception has really deteriorated during the pandemic i seriously dont know what the hype is all about is it because people get killed while playing a game is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better to me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long started well but mid way through it gets tired and feels sluggish the games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc the ending was horrible and vagueit shows that losers will be losers even after winning just not relevant in todays world nothing more than a korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism democracy ethics etc terrible acting cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time this show has a great script excellent actors but fails to keep the viewers interested because it is really slow i often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer adding very little to the plot this show could easily have  episodes and that would improve a lot its entertaining value quickly became my favorite show of all time honestly i found it extraordinary one of the very few times ive found a show worthy of all the hype from the cinematography to the concept and everything in between but please watch it with subtitles it makes a huge difference i watched it dubbed the second time amd it takes so much away very entertaining and high in production quality but it suffered from some predictable writing and over the top acting issues it was obvious from the get go who was going to win and last the longest because those were characters that received the most development however some of the plot twists worked including the one at the end most episodes were well paced and a pleasure to watch thanks to lots of brutal action and decent dialogue but the episode when everybody left could have been better ill also say that the red hair ending and not getting on the plane was a bit weird and it was disappointing not hearing anything more about the police officer considering how op he was earlier on several characters were overdone acting and dialogue wise like the woman who struggled to find a team and the main character in places however there was a good mix of characters the acting was generally impressive and the extras did a good job then the cinematography setspropscostumes visual effects editing and soundtrack were all excellent for a tv show this show was terrible dont waste your time believe the hype truly awesome tv boring and predictable let s start saying that eastern culture is completely different from the westernsaid that i don t understand how this show is popular in europe us this is just the proof that people follow what is popular many asian might find this serie amazing but from a western guy point of view i have to say  acting was terrible a lot of overreaction for nothing read that dubbing was bad not at all that s how asians talk and behave if you didn t like the dubbing is because you don t like the style as different from your culture  everything in the movie was very predictable at least untill episode  then i stopped watching  extremely forced and pointless emotional scene build up on hypocrisy and very obvious cliches the idea itself was nothing new but good the rest rubbish i could like it if i was asian or maybe  years old without splatter scene this show is very overrated and overhyped its a unique concept but it feels very unoriginal with all that said it was very entertaining show that keeps the viewers engaged throughout most of it its very detailed and one of my favorite details is the main characters number with his number in the game being  it was a constant reminder of how many other players there were overall its worth a watch but goes over the top in the genre every once in a while i dont honestly understand the plot line or attraction to this show i dont know how anyone could not like this show im looking forward to netflixs future foreign offerings finally finished the writing was fairly obvious and very heavy handed but overall it was entertaining this was one of those shows where once it hooks you youre along for the ride and what a great ride it was three stars for a great first few episodes  star for not holding the quality till the end absolute loved this series hope theres a season  its good its not as big as the hype its not an original plot but its well written amazing characters the show made you worry about them ok its rather fun but also grossly overrated something is lacking here  were used to torture porn for the entertainment of rich people so no surprise here  the motivation of the puppet master is ridiculous and doesnt make sense from a psychological point of view so eventually if the show is entertaining and an easy critics of our capitalist system it doesnt really quench the thirst it gives you in the first place i watched it till the end but mainly out of curiosity the concept is interesting but predictable the acting is bad but the dynamics and the filming are good it gives a perspective of a world gone mad with many hopeless indebted poor being the willing participants in a capitalist game despite the heavy theme there is not much depth in the fim makers analysis of exploitation but its rather an excuse for violent entertainment this is one of the best things i have seen in a while it has a simple but interesting story line and has some emotional parts in this is a must see i loved the character development and the sets were great but i felt like the last episode was kind of boring and the ending didnt make much sense i didnt like the series it doesnt make any sense i would rather see a series with  or  seasons about the life of josé castelo branco too ridiculous series i dont understand how people like this dump absolutely incredible i watched the dubbed version and decided to rewatch the entire series in its original language with english subs if youre not into gore blood or violence its definitely not for you its fine worth your time legit emotional rollercoaster laughed and cried a must see this is an amazing korean drama this drama really show the true colors when one is desperate for money its good but too much character development that wasnt needed should have been ½ hour episodes instead of the hour long ones that most of them were im sorry but super overrated aside from the politics great watch the originality of the sets visuals and characters is entertaining and bingeworthy maybe a little predictable for those of us who have watched so many movies but recommended nevertheless absolutely brilliant great writing every damn actor did a great job the english dub is kind of charming its funny at times but i came to think of those voices as his or hers characters voice this is not some korean version of hunger games i found this infinitely more interesting and entertaining than hunger games it really is a must see its good but not that good to justify all the hype awesome bingwatched honestly i didnt know what to expect from this show things got fricken deep though i almost cried watching ali die he was my favorite character immediately this show has interesting story telling to keep viewers engaged characters to love and characters to hate tear jerking moments character development and deep themes not for the faint of heart but still a great show'"

              "'i know korea is still a mysoginistic society until now because there government doesnt want women to have power and more equal rights than men and thats the sad truth of the society but judging the story it felt flat for me the beginning episodes are great but after episode it felt draggy and slow and i get the betrayal of friends part but i think it feels so injustice of the other characters especially ali they didi him dirty and still koreans always look down dark or brown skinned people i hate it here and still racist to foreigners ngl though and the ending is still open ended so weed a nd season to answer all the several plotholes of previous episodes acting is phenomenal hands down especially saebyeok i love her role in this its giving me katnis everdeen vibes heheheh purr and gihun too i love his kind honest protagonist and especially the front man i love villainess of the characters high budget production outfits stages evrything felt flat for the ost i need lisas money fpr the ost of the nd season please it matches the series thats all yall should watch alice in borderland it has better plot than the squid game purr the show was amazing the way i was crying for characters i have only known them for episodes is just crazy cause this is the first time it has happened to me the way they have developed the characters even if we dont know that much about their background other than gihun but honestly they never tell us anything like why he debt or any other information so its crazy how i started crying this also just proves how the acting is just amazing and i loved the cast and they fit so well with the roles and the chemistry with each other was amazing too also i was so happy seeing a south asian character because its not very common to see them and even if you do see them they are small roles no main characters so i was very very happy about that me being an indian myself the music was also so good the song matched the vibe so well such as when they played happy songs in bad situations it really matched well with the childrens game theme or the pink soldiers song gave such an eerie vibe but i kept wanting to listen to the song even though it kinda freaked me out a little lastly i loved the story so much but if im going to be honest the story was pretty basic but it was still so addicting and i binged the whole show in one sitting so i still totally reccomed watching i love this show so much and im so happy for the show and the actors for all the international attention this show is getting and other kdramas suddenly getting after squid game like the stories are so good they deserve it yayyyy squid game was truly something else i expected a bunch of games but did i expect everything that happened during and after the games no definitely not this obviously needs a season since the ending was kind of crappy dont get me wrong the beginning and the show in general was excellent however i wish the ending was a little more developed seong gi hoon was an interesting character he was naïve of a sort even though he was been through a lot even after what happened at the end he continued to live his life the way it was before cho sang woo honestly did not deserve to last so long in the games this man was dangerous and we couldnt even detect it kang sae byeok was the best character hands down she faced everything headon which is something i want to do whenever im in the middle of a situation hwang jun ho was pretty irrelevant in my opinion because his purpose was to only find his brother who went missing the hot thing about him was that he always used the words of someone whenever he was violated theres no closure about him which i wish did happen hopefully in season well get closure about him ali was too innocent in this drama all he wanted was money for his wife and kid poor guy couldnt even get anything but he left his family a good amount oh il nami dont know i have a confusing view about him he treated the guys so nice but at the end what he explained was messed up ji yeong was also badass her ending is undeserved she deserved a second chance theres a bunch of other characters i would have reviewed but meh its whatever lol its competent in most aspects the hype honestly makes it a worse experience because you expect something mindblowing and genre breaking its not that its battle royale fall guys its mostly enjoyable the social commentary is a bit heavy handed at times but its nice to have it there its not that original its not perfect its fine random note the scenes with english speaking foreigners were hilarious the writing was mostly ok but it didnt come off as entirely natural and combined with notstellar acting it felt odd i guess like asian scenes feel in western movies maybe yeah worth the hype i wasnt wowed by the first episode of this drama nor entirely enchanted by the second but by the end of the second episode i thought dang okay fine i guess i want to keep watching and im glad i did the most thrilling and emotional parts of this show took place within the game itself the games are simple childrens games but are games that dont necessarily require skill most of the time its luck which number you drew which shape you got that sort of thing the game purports to be fair but its only fair in the way that real life is fair youre stuck with the cards youve been given the poor characters take part in the game because the real world is so terrible for them that the game is the best alternative theyve got sadly some even think they can win despite as weve discussed the games being largely luckbased the characters are mostly pretty decent in this the main character gi hoon is initially kind of a piece of trash but you realize that hes a gambling addict and this leads to him hurting the people he loves hes not an inherently bad person who wants to hurt others and you see that come out in the game where hes one of the kinder people there the rest of the cast are also great not a weak performance in sight id say the cops plotline and character are mildly confusing and vague and youre just not that emotionally invested in it compared to everyone else the show continues to get better and better as the games keep going and people dienpeople die in very emotionally impacting ways and i think they did all the character deaths very well they often feel different too whether its because it was accidental somebody cheated so they lost or just bad luck and the deaths can weirdly almost feel like a part of their character arcs i dont know how the writers pulled it off but they did it well tldr its really worth watching because its not just trashy fun it has so much to say about the unfairness of the systems in this world that keep poor people down im not sure id rewatch it because its so emotionally overwhelming at times but it is super good average for its genre dont get me wrong this is a pretty decent show but at the same time the ending didnt satisfied me at all it ended like this in order to have more seasons ofc but idk for me it lacked smt survival movies or tv shows are never a concept i find revolutionary so i think its pretty funny how of all the kdramas out there this one is the most watched on netflix not only that but its the top most watched shows on netlix of all time i understand everything and all that but if i ever survived such a crazy hell i would either end up killing myself regardless or just really living and doing everything ive ever wanted might as well whats the worst that can happen i watched this on the spur of the moment after having intention of watching it previously because tbh how many times have mangaanime fans seen this survival game concept growing up with japanese entertainment nothing about this show was new at all but i still loved it i suppose for westerners it might be new but for me the shock factors or disturbing qualities didnt stand out from originality but from the pure execution i could say the majority of the plot turns were predictable as well but the pacing and performances were so good that it kept me on the edge of my seat the violencegore wasnt emotionally or mentally straining and was easy to get to used to after the initial shocks of the first two episodes i loved the detective passionately d and not just because that man is incredibly fine but his character addition really added to the quick pacing of the show mixing in another storyline so as to almost give us a breather from the dirty inhumane warehouse feeling the other characters endured i believe that the alternations of characterstory focuses was what was really done well because it always kept you rolling and focused a next next next action experience the only reason im not giving it a is because i really felt that the ending of some characters was rushed episode definitely lacked the full emotional appeal of loss for me and i was mildly disappointed but i understand there was a time crunch ive never stayed up all night to watch a show before but i did for squid game i was absolutely groggy the next day but it was worth it im currently rewatching it with my mom and it is still an incredibly crisp viewing the camerawork and colors were executed very very well and i look forward to watching hwang dong hyuks other works the novelty of squid game thats all over media is western hype in my opinion but tbh with how well done this show was it probably deserves it i wasnt sure at first that this would be for me im usually more of a romance based story lover but this really surprised me squid game has no romance and i wasnt bothered in the least about it i was just an interesting story with morally grey compelling characters im a bit confused about the ending im not sure if they did it that way so that there could possibly be another season or just to make the viewer think but overall this kept me very engaged and i really liked it a lot if the creators were to do another show set in this world i would love to see more about how it started how the workers are chosen and just more about the frontman the frontman had the potential to be a really interesting character the story just wasnt focusing on him i just want to know why he chose to join the game maybe even spoilers see what his original game was like and ultimately led him to abandon his family and become a major part of the game a brilliant show fully worth watching this is a show that is simultaneously brutal and beautiful in its depiction and execution its a fantastic metaphor for capitalism and the illusion of autonomy the compulsion to survive that drives the poorest when their supposed freedoms and choices are constrained by a need to survive anyone could have left the game but out in the real world the pressures would not let them so they stayed and played i thought gihun was a weak and unsympathetic character i didnt like the actors constipated expressions at everything and i thought the support cast was better in terms of sympathetic characters and acting the plot itself was formulaic but still great lot of the deaths were foreshadowed but that often made the prelude thick with emotional suspense and a desperation to be proven wrong the games were brutal and i thought in particular that episodes and were masterful again i felt let down by the main character and i also found everything on the side with the undercover policeman to be an unnecessary addition which could instead have been devoted to fleshing out the back stories of some of the other characters i found the north korean defector sorry i cant remember her name the most interesting whilst ali and the old man were the most endearing this show really though could only be endured if you hated the characters as soon as you began liking someone they were bound to die copied storyline with a weird ending and way too much blood i watched this because everyone keeeps talking about this seriespostitive points very good production high quality the actors gave a great performance really cant say anything bad about that negative points the whole story is just well it reminds me a lot of alice in borderland expect that alice in borderland was a lot better in my opinion the ending of squid game is kinda predictable and not satisfying at all there isnt really a happy ending for anyone tbh i dont get the hype there are way better korean asian series out there still i think its cool that people start recognizing korean asian series movies more if you like blood gore and mind fck this series is for you if you dont better watch something else squid game is one of the most exciting series to hit netflix in some time it mashes up the carefree idyllic days of childhood with the brutal realism of adulthood as it forces everyday people to compete in life or death matches in a bid to potentially wipe out their debts equal parts gutwrenching and squirminducing it’s a whiteknuckle thriller drama and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer it’s one of the most unique things you’ll watch this year and maybe ever show was lame very weirdly paced and slow it wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee dont follow the hype either idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense you dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show this show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as br skip this or watch if your bored the fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews including the established critics celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the st century so much is wrong with this series yes the whole idea behind it that i hardly know where to start but ill try the purely cinematic criticism first the character development is ad hoc in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible the character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script the supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else scattered in to show humanity friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there they are ultimately not figures in themselves the cinematography is okay but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic which is so full of wealth greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such antivalues but their celebration the music the score are completely irrelevant and immature they have no influence on the film the script has as many gaps as a swiss cheese and storylines go untold the actors are sometimes like that but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory they often only convey one and when the going gets tough maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings aside from these obvious aspects however the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hideandseek the producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth unscrupulousness greed for money and in the ultimate end a moral story about ethics humanity and humanism but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath interested in topics instead the show should and will be driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance the last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively a game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here artistic love for the medium of film or an affection for pop culture none of it i have a hard time expressing how much i hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away our world like ancient rome seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time have fun and welcome to the squid games im out starts off pretty well in the first episode then its just downhill and pointless the ending make you regret you wasted nine hours on the crap it turns out everything is dread nothing has any meaning and no one gets happy for anything doom gloom and bad acting is all you get after now over unhelpfuls here we go again guys i dont know what to say squid game is not a good show its garbage i hope there wont be a season a spin off or a movie watch the first episode if you cant resist the marketing hype youll see its a but since these few points due to the fresh storyline are undeserved its heavily inspired by the mangaanime kaiji and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies ill give it a abysmal overacting puppet characters unrealistic and unrefined stuff even teens which are the main target once the novelty factor fades will recognize that its trash sadly and stupidly i watched every episode easily predictable on what happens and whos who the acting is woeful with even worse dubbing if i can remember who recommended this to me id throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting hours of my life on utter dross its not unique its not different its all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surprise if i can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done could not relate to the story or any of the characters just didnt even care who lives who dies loopholes in the story galore unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter in the end was like yawn whatever no issues with gore in movies seen plenty in others but the storyactingscreenplay should hold and carry the movie through this felt like it is riding on the wave movies like parasite created for korean cinematv bloated overhyped nonsense at best give it a skip and save your time could barely get through the first mins of this extremely boring cheesy unstimulating i kept skipping ahead because it just dragged on and on a lot of over acting i do not understand what the hype is all about this is not illogical and just waste of time dnd trying to infuriate ton play stupid games dont want just waste of time only a sociopath will like watching something like this the show has very negative energy and it affects the audience if you dont realise that im sorry for you i love thrillers and horror movies if they have a point in them this is too much because there are literally so many people living in debt especially now during covid and the suicide rates have skyrocketed because of it this is not funny nor interesting nor enjoyable to watch therefore i vote it in the gutter because it is now influencing our young kid at school that are hurting each other in the yard while copying it the talk and reviews have me bewildered im only up to ep but am struggling after about attempts to start bingeing i find it boring and really childish with pretty ordinary acting the set design art direction and general production values are very s two more attempts then ill give up its really not that good highly predictable and the ending was terrible i will say though the main character and his acting wasnt too bad enjoyed watching him but other than that its a waste of time anticlimactic is the perfect word for this series let me preface no i am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it i have seen many horrorthrillers including the death game genre so while i thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones i cant wrap my head around the hype many people bring up how it is similar to x game book movie etc so im thinking netflix created a way for casual and nonhorror viewers to get exposure to it thinking its new or innovating complaints about that aside the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainmentwise for me it is watchable for sure but certain characters mainly the cop are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or rewritten also annoying is yes the vips act horribly and yes everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being theres only one winner in summary was it good depends on personal taste was it genius unique or without flaws absolutely not i didnt enjoy it enough to binge but it made for a decent casual viewing id suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be first off the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in takashi miikes kamisama no iu tôri it almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director second i mostly have experience with south korean horror movies and ive always thought that south korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted japanese and chinese but the acting in squid game definitely feels more theatrical which is not a good thing imo its hard to connect with the story and the actors when theyre expressing every emotion with shouting flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces this might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in asia but i prefer the realistic kind the show was decent worth watching but not as great as some are saying took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing get ready for season you know not that bad considering overhype ephemera no more but has a good picture music and lets say not so banal development of events of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer but for most series and viewers lets say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement usually it is so strongest side of this series is an acting it is really solid i think considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as a hype is a hype is a hype and our actual societys zeitgeist the series is far away from the mentioned masterpiece its starts very good the first parts are very enjoyable but then it goes down quite quickly everything is far too obvious from the beginning everything is so clear not one single surprise to the end and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline the bad dialogues and the overacting furthermore full of plotholes another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes all in all nothing special how is this currently on a score of the lead character was so annoying in the first minutes that i switched it off and was then persuaded a couple of days later to see it through its not a patch on either battle royale or the american version of that hunger games it drags on and on and on and the ending is just flat watch it if you must because of the bingehype value but it has little to offer any serious film buff good idea for a show but poor execution of it totally overrated but then i saw the american actors that play a role and i knew that all the acting was really bad starts off shocking and kinda intriguing and fades into being dumb and boring had a hard time paying attention by the end good theme but story developed in a bad way poor direction idle for hr movie release than that of an episode series i loved it but three last episodes killed the vibe a great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of moneyapparently mil american they must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing like the sopranos with some of the episodes better than others number six was the best for me the sets are wes anderson like with bright colors filling the screen the lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written the violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight the final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall i was highly entertained i genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end a true social commentary on humanity competition and avarice when the carnage is occurring its nailbiting and between the games you get compelling human drama a fantastic addition to the kill game genre that seems to always be elevated by korean talent behind and in front of the camera this is an entertaining series from south korea that embodies elements of korean soap opera chinese operatic acting and japanese theater it uses classical chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and angerand a lot of shouting it uses hunger games as its base and survival of the fittest as its main theme the story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode it then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode it is set up for a second season if one can judge from the final episode but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven have to agree with the other comments about the group of actors playing the vips they obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all enjoyable for what its meant to be a tentacular dystopian vision of the depths those deserted of luck will descend to in order to recover their losses combines schadenfreude shades aplenty alongside some outstanding performances while asking some questions you might not want to find an answer to for those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series basically the series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that youll definitely notice and say when youre watching that character is me it is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end the same money that come from the blood and sweat of others the capitalist system claims that there is equity and justice in the distribution of the wealth and this is far from the truth as for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process money is no longer their pleasure that they only find pleasure in people suffer when he finally wins some moneyonly to lose it seconds later i turned it off and didnt come back for a while but eventually i did and it is pretty good of course it drags minute episodes into hour long episodesbut its still good both twists were so predictable the police brother and the old man were so obviousand what is the message of the showbeing rich is just awfullol korea must have lots of poor people squid game is a great tv show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money the tv show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money i enjoyed the tv show it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes some mysteries also and some big revelations i enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch i will recommend anyone to watch this tv show it was quite good perfect to binge watching this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments while not really perfect this is a perfectly fine netflix entertainment totally recommended its different but the same basically a different take on the violent game shows were nobody really wins episode was the best episode if theres a season two it needs to be the revenge if you enjoy korean movies then this is a must see has become a real hit cool idea interesting games and drama plenty of story to continue more seasons ive got final eps left but have really enjoyed up to this point typical korean ott actionand some real life back stories thrown in for good measure was good to see a non korean ali abdul in this thoroughly entertaining and a great distraction from all the madness in the world this tv show is very good to me something different from what we are used to watch for me is very original this is the first korean drama ive watched while i was absolutely blown away there were a couple of moments where i thought the story dragged a little however it was all added for tension im sure it was absolutely stunning to look at and really well done i cant wait to see what happens in the next series great show korean drama that is perceivable for n american audience similar story attempts have been made in the past but this one has a great blend of drama with a little unpleasantries wow no show has ever stressed me out as much as this one it was seriously insane and crazy and hilarious all at once kept me on the edge of my seat thats for sure it had me laughing and crying and terrified well directed pretty good writing uneven acting partly over the top theatrical partly just as it should be well produced and shot keeps viewers attention slightly predictable at moments and in general masterfully edited and with an appropriate music score as the tile says good watch but only once since then youll know the secret and the mystery will be gone forever really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin started very strong up until episode then went downhill with all the vip stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on has great production values and acting episode was the best one by a mile but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how season will turn out this was a generally ok show very typical of an anime series just another game show game where people fight it out to the death some sets were stupid like the arcade machines that could wipe surveillance footage of people in a hallway magically with one random arcade button none of that typey typey break the code and delete just okay this button should probably be preprogramed to erase evidence of stuff ended up not even being a part of the end story plot yo hello anyone listening no answers on the harvest body parts just the you can sell them or eat them i dont care but part then boom that entire plot is gone seriously i have picked apart this entire series and its just absolutely a typical live action anime bad dub and all i cant tell if the actors sucked of if it was the voice over actors first episodes drew me in as something new but series left me feeling like i just watched another dumb anime not an exciting drama with original characters this show revealed a lot to me about how people stereotype the rest of the world based on racist stereotypes is all media propaganda in some way or another in the first episodes there was a sense of potential in the series but as it progresses it felt like the scriptwriters are just adding cliches not something i would expect from a korean drama i expected it to be unique not your usual survivalthemed series and you know the type that gets you thinking everything about this screams american storyline predictability acting character development if there is any and concept it was lackluster and i honestly was cringing just wishing it to be over i predicted almost everything except gong yoo’s role the casts are great starstudded even but when those foreigners started acting i had the hardest cringe of my life they made a bad series even worse i’m not ecstatic for a season but i can already smell a possible storyline not to mention lee byunghun’s brother who i presumed to be alive because the gunshot is not fatal i’ll give season the benefit of the doubt but i’m really sorry coz this season is not worth my time probably the most horrible acting i have ever seen the writers of this probably wear goat masks and blow eachother just like in the show the storyline is so bad that i think netflix should start recruiting people in grade if they don’t already by the way that idea is patent pending lol i think i will run a series where netflix employees are given certain castings then imprisoned to play games to the death that is yet another great idea just within a review cheers compelling visually intriguing exciting fast paced and innovative it has all the right credentials apart from the inane and unnecessary violence i don’t give a jot for all the reviews that say it’s a clever commentary on society today it is not it is a show that does nothing other than glorify death for no reason whatsoever any clever commentary could have been communicated without the need for death and worse the volume of people who are raving about it what does that say about our society that so many are utterly unaffected by such gratuitous murder that it’s justifiable that their lives were of no value and expendable just because they were financially ruined i didn’t get what moral this show was trying to teach me but surely there has to be some deeper truth to justify such macabre storytelling i watched one episode and that was enough shame on you netflix for peddling such brutality one of the worst shows of the genre the one star given is for aesthetics but other than that the series delivers nothing more than a combination of ideas from other survival game dramas and movies besides the dramatic acting approach and impressive setting the series failed to deliver its messaging despite wanting to appear deep and introspective mildly annoyed by how many perceive this show to be more clever and introspective than it is many aspects are not explained well or there’s really no meaning behind them at all not a fan of whole killing spree but the series was off to a good start with recruiting and with games but major bummer was the end wth was that ending throughout the series it was conveyed to the audience the is a good man except in marble game and then he just idling with his life for one whole year without fulfilling the promises he made for the last dying ones in the game when he had billions in his account ending was pathetic to the point make me feel it was such a waste of time watching all that there are unwanted scenarios in the series the idea of story is genius smart but sorry to say i dont like this film because to many provide sadistic violence inhuman many students of my country talking and interesting about this movie although their age are not enough and not allowed to see the movie hope if this film will be released in seriescould you please make it with softly because your movie inspired many peoplethank you and success for your team i left the first episode with pain in my chest…literally this show is not smart not entertaining and an unfortunate representation of what we are expected to believe that money and hate overrule humanity netflix does not fail in releasing one show after the other that depict the big lie that humanity knows nothing but hate jealousy betrayal anger and filth the truth is that humanity is capable of so much love but we will never see that on yet another mass propaganda channel please spend your time spreading the right messages serving the world to be a better place and indulging in good smart and uplifting content…not this the filming and pace is okay but most characters are inconsequential and lackluster theres no real meaningful character development in this series many promising characters starting out but most ended up being just plot devices to get the story moving virtually nothing will change if you swap some of the main characters out games are also extremely bland compared to similar pieces like liar game or alice in borderland considering there are without giving spoilers quite a few a games and they take up significant amount of the screen time the fact that there are almost no clever design to these games and how they play out is very disappointing it is an okay series as pastime however if you compare it to any serious predecessor in the genre this one is quite pale in comparison especially at its core if you like watching people get killed while playing children games for money at any cost to win or gamble wtheir life to get out of a financial crisis then this is your netflix tv series movie i found it to be downright disturbing considering the world we live in today it definitely fits into the grand scheme of things during this pandemic what people will do for money especially when you are forced to make that decision it shows who has morals or not in conclusion definitely not my cup of tea but maybe someone elses flavor but the story suffers in the ending the reaction of the protagonist became abnormal to the point of him trying to kill a dying man on his deathbed can he be a little compassionate like when he wanted to just stop the last game because he suddenly grew a conscience talking slowly when he saw his mother lying on the floor the normal reaction is to call for help immediately and him living like a beggar for a year not using his winnings the ending would have been better when the last part was the scene from the atm showing the whooping amount he earned the main character is boring and relies on luck too much the sets are creative but the characters have such basic and cookie cutter arcs not to mention the parts with the doctor player were extremely boring and many unnecessary scenes were added the reveal at the end and the purpose of the squid game didn’t really have an effect for me it led to sort of a “so what” conclusion a good show to kill time if you’ve got not much else to watch made it through most of episode before bailing no sympathy for selfinflicted losers sob stories and no interest in seeing the suffering they cause others the girl or the mother were the only redeeming characters and watching them suffer offers no joy dont care what happens to deranged gamblers so why watch the acting is melodramatic caricatures more cartoonish than appealing and the concept is just absurd the production values are high so stars for that just personal opinion the whole drama is vibrant all actors performance is awesome bringing the drama to a different level its a good show but very sexist towards women it showing young kids that men are stronger than women its disgusting it will make girls feel like they cant grow up to stand up for themselves they make women seem less than overall should empower women more as their are a lot of women out their who work their but off to fight and be strong overall good show also is this off how korea treats those who are poor should have made women to be seen as more confident and stronger the premise itself is good and the first few episodes are wellexecuted but theres a bit of a cultural clash regarding some of the tropes and the characters mindsets when presented to a western audience egalitarianism between the sexes isnt as progressed in korea so the repeated emphasis on the female players being weaker undesirable teammates was pretty grating the ending was very disappointing after such a large amount of character development i expected better you do get to grow fond of characters and there are many anticipated plot twists some points in the storyline seemed like they were tied off hastily somethings were left with lackluster if any answers not sure if it’s a ploy to lead up to a second season but i found myself literally angry at the end for a character’s entire motive to just be abandoned at the last minute is just irritating redemption was available many times over for the main character just to be fumbled and squandered production was gorgeous though the vips would be more tolerable without any lines as they remained anonymous and got away ultimately nothing would have been missed i binged it the entire day and it was good but i didnt like the ending too but the acting was amazing plus the set it’s wacky… it’s sappy… it goes from slapstick zany to blood splattering gruesome… and emotionally fluctuates with really extreme characterssituations it’s kind of all over the place in my opinion it was ok there were some characterizations and stereotypes that i found slightly offensive and there were some elements that were so illogical it completely pulled my focus out of the main actions when a group of certain special people arrive i think it gets kind of dumb the colors and aesthetics of the costumeset design are stunning but i think some of the masks are just way over the top i love mask i’ve made masks and often wear large obnoxious masks at halloween parties i know how cumbersome and uncomfortable they can get there’s no way some of the characters in the show would be wearing those gaudy hot heavy masks all the time that said the characters are mostly engaging and story is bizarre enough to keep one watching till the end a lot of people that is new to the genre might find this show entertaining personally i enjoyed some parts of this show but most of the time i find myself questioning the simplicity of the games itself the shallow plotline building up moral compasses that leads to nowhere and disappointing character developments yeah i am talking about the main character he is as selfish as he was during the first episode and the last episode this is the first time i am putting my review for any tv series squid game is definitely an engaging and intriguing series and a binge watch for all the twist in the end was great as i never saw that coming and the ending of the first season tells us that a second season is om its way soon this series is very interesting and definitely keeps you wanting to watch more just because the events happening in the show but honestly i had to watch the show in incriminates because if i watched too much at once i’d get sick to my stomach because this show is pretty gruesome it shows pretty rough things and honestly makes you think how it’s rated on netflix right now personally i think no one under the age should watch this series because of the events that happen anyone with trauma i don’t think should watch this either because of the scenes i don’t want to ruin anything for anyone who reads this but warning to all its gruesome i would like to write an honest review im not going to write what people seeing on internet about show truth is it was a good series no doubt acting skills are so damn good but it obviously bored you in last episodes where there is need of adreline rush obviously episode are best in the entire series i would like to suggest you people do not follow the hype created about the show on social network media there are other series and movie better than that but didnt get praised all those hype they had created on social media is paid n one mormost important thing i fall sleep watching this show twice now you can conclude on your own the first few episodes were captivating mostly for the shock factor but unfortunately i think it fell off entirely after episode six which is meant to be very sad but how can we feel that sad for anyone when we have become so desensitised to people dying already there were a few should we just skip moments in the last two episodes due to the drag after finishing the show i felt a little unsatisfied overall it was a well produced show and showcased some brilliant acting even if the story falls off at the end still worth a watch the only negative point of this series is its too slow plus many of the scenes are streched very unnecessarily for eg in last episode theres a two way communication and it is been streched continuously for half and hours and its damn boring i dont know what the makers were thinking they might have thought that yes were creating great suspense but no youre making the audience feel bore the positive things are the sets and performance every actor just killed it in their role also the sets were designed very beautifully for the task the show has some really brilliant scenes but in the end comes to a predictable and tame ending the ending couldve been so much more i would say a good watch for creative and concept value as well as the performances by the entire cast not a bad series but highly overated in my opinion the story is old but the acting is superb cruelty is similar to saw and tarantino a lot of moral dilemmas arise as the show progresses the uniforms and the playground songs are well placed not recommended for anyone under it can be rough for audiences that dont like death games movies it is disturbing gross and insane the show isnt binge worthy if youre easily triggered by violence deep down it is a lesson how nostalgia the urge to make money can actually kill you the series had a motive of showing the people that they are actually different kinds of animals in the world but there is a difference animals dont think alternatively humans do they are very ugly inside actually we dont have feelings at all we use it for our own advantage humans always consider for their selves first and then their loved ones this series will give you how people are seen in different situations when they are placed money will buy you everything but we humans are never ever satisfied fantastic show to begin with really hooks you in and it becomes essential to watch till the end as the show progresses however it does begin to get somewhat tiresome cliché and there are some really drawn out episodes towards the end that drag with some questionable writing my oh my goodness this season excited me and to be brutally honest first episode i didn’t have much clue to what it was about i hadn’t even watched a trailer for it and to be honest i don’t really like the name of the show squid game but the a old saying in life don’t judge a book by its cover and i guess that old saying rings true here ending was dragged out a bit and although they have made it very suggestive of a possible season the fact it was dragged out this way has definitely decreased the ending scenes quality significantly however if it had not done this i could not see this advancing into a second season smoothly if at all absolutely amazing show i have never left a review on any show i’ve ever watched in my entire life but i recommend this show to everyone the plot is not predictable which i find very intriguing kudos to the creators because this show it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society not only does this show keep you hooked but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole with all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one i’ve seen to date there are some gory scenes for those who need a trigger warning but all in all i highly recommend this show to anyone for the impact that it has on you it’s much needed perspective growth that more people should delve into this show is really amazing you can feel each characters emotions and feeling well the first half of this show make you feel various kind of feelings just like roller coaster is going on and then in the half its become heavy and tense last of the episodes are really heart wrenching i mean i cant hold my tears it was to heavy well this show wont let you down in any aspects i haven’t watch any type of production so damn moving emotionally albeit this show is extremely emotionally and mentally draining it truly is personally moving and simply amazing work done by the writercreator production staff director and actors whom simply make this show one of the greatest film or movie i’ve ever laud witness to the character building alone is that of legendary status while each of the main casts actors are so perfectly cast and act their roles in ways i didn’t expect this isn’t just a korean hunger games by any means but more like a human case study on our nature and society as human beings this is a must watch for all adults as i’m sure young people will love the violence and story but adults will immediately relate with this show on so many levels i finished this series in days it keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you cant stop watching one complaint i have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field cough clickbait cough but squid game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective the acting and character development is so good you really feel for the characters which makes their demise that much more devastating this show is a must watch i binged this show and i loved it everyone i recommended this show to loved it great characters and a wellwritten story that makes you want more ive never left reviews before but squid game deserves it the acting is amazing even for the guards who you cant see their faces but they still hold a lot of emotion spoilers i loved rewatching it and finding all the hints i missed about the games on the wall or player not being scanned during red light green light the characters were so well written and even relatable that it was truly sad to see them die spoilers over i highly recommend watching this show for yourself its truly amazing and grabs you from the start it made number on netflix so it clearly did something right wow what an awesome series despite the fact that possible spoiler alert if it is its easy to predict who will win since whoever is considered the main character almost always outlasts everyone everything else is just mindblowingly welldone you admire this show as an exquisite piece of art the soundtrack is fantastic really ominous and foreboding like the show setsprops are actually inspired by real works of art and incorporate things from real life allowing scenes to stick in your mind acting is topnotch everyone plays their part to their character story has a lot of depth too and little details that foreshadow events things you come to realize only after youve finished the show lets you appreciate how much thought has gone into making this show most importantly its a story thats resonating with a lot of people who are struggling to get by every day even with people who are welloff but feel the intense pressures of being in a competitive society we live in today its moving its powerful its beautiful watch it squid game is neatly written welldirected and one of the most vibrant show that i have ever come across in recent times the character development storyline and plot execution are jawdropping it really pushes you to think out of the box and questions your personal belief of humanity life relationship and most importantly how far an individual is willing to go for money even though if it requires the harshest of sacrifices this is the definition of a bingeworthy show havent seen a drama for a while the storys usually seem to get repetitive and quite predictable but not this one apart from the fact that it was obvious the protagonist would survive since the story revolved around him every episode was packed with twists at every turn really had me on up my toes it was so refreshing to watch a such a clever and wellthought out drama with some very thoughtprovoking life lessons the cast needless to say made it all the more worth watching i am a korean drama addict but squid game really has the potential to get anyone hooked its that good i have never written a review for a show before but this one was so good that i honestly just had to especially since i finished the series in days unlike alice in borderland which many claim to be similar to this show squid game truly makes you feel connected to the characters which ultimately makes their demise all the more heartbreaking the show is not as gory as some japanese counterparts but definitely does make you feel uneasyunsettled love how the show ties together childrens games and twists them into something far more sinister i truly hope to see a season soon wow i was truly blown away by this amazing series every single thing about this show draws you in and it keeps you hooked i stayed up way later then i shouldve when having to go to work the next day just to keep watching the acting couldnt be better the idea is similar to others but this one is still so original at the same time it had a little bit of every genre in this to where i know anyone would end up liking this series ive really been enjoying a lot of the south korean series that netflix has been streaming lately i hope they keep it up and i will be so upset if this doesnt get a season i finished this series in just day it keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns that you cant stop watching one complaint i have of shows that try too hard to be shocking is that sometimes it feels misleading and like the reveal comes from left field cough clickbait cough but squid game manages to pull off twists that are believable and makes you want to rewatch again with the new perspective the acting and character development is so good you really feel for the characters which makes their demise that much more devastating it keeps you on the edge but i feel it is overrated the old man is wise and it is nice to learn of the games korean people play we have same safe games in zimbabwe however i think this is just an evil show could be made better maybe dismis players who loose instead of killing them what does it teach one about soul i feel a human life is important and should not be toyed with yes the acting was good playout of the enitre story was good too everything was great except the story line it was an exact replica of hunger games we have seen it before this drama to me it illustrated the diminishing of human values and norms it depicts what really happens in our society regardless of where you at geographically the rich seems to be above the law they get away with a lot of things they prey on the poor what a sad society so sad the movie is not that great it’s entertaining enough to watch i was so excited when i saw the trailer but the series is disappointing concept was really cool there were parts in there that were quite exciting however didnt like the character development especially the end great start badly wrapped up entertaining great visuals the general idea of the story is a combination of famous movie clichés and horror seriesrnthe side stories of the series were practically incomplete and without context great concept and could have been brilliant but the character development and story telling are really bad very unrealistic scenarios shame perfect beautiful and lovely the first few episodes were fun to watch as they played out but as the series progressed a more serious ominous storyline starts to unfold due to viewers empatheticly connecting with a few of the characters facing uncertainty as the game continues even possible death i found the series in the overall really great refreshingly new and well planned out as it unfolded i hope that somehow the series will continue on into the future with many more seasons to come a great show from my perspective one of the most beautiful series ive ever seen finished in a few days one episode led to another and the desire to follow the series increases more and more the tension is built very well game by game and the main characters are really well developed squid game is definitely a slow burn in its first episodes but they do give you a taste of whats to come as for the rest of the season you probably wont be able to stop watching thanks to its story characters thrills twists games and of course gore ive watched the whole lot and its just plain silly the cast bring overacting to a new level all the characters are spectacularly annoying i wanted them all to die by episode and i dont know why i watched it all im sure there were far better things i could have been doing with my life like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails its really woeful squid game is a different type of show and im all for it i really liked watching this the hidden message seems to be about the crisis of debt in south korea and just how far some desperate people are willing to do for some cash i thought it was a very intense adventure that was followed such an entertaining craft this show has been made into i avoided the reviews upon watching instead i decided to give it a go and im glad i did as its very engaging to the point you cannot watch one episode this is definitely a bingeworthy one to catch as soon as possible before the internet ruins it for you i definitely recommend watching this some moments will have you laughing although others will have you the complete opposite it got me good on some parts in both ways check it out now on netflix believe the hype this is one of the best shows to ever hit netflix every episode gets better and better and the acting is spot on the action scenes are beautiful the whole concept is crazy but in this case crazy works i bought into the hype and watched this mess i am very confused about what people see in it i can look past the horrible over acting by the vo artists stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development i stuck it out until the end and was completely let down by far the worst finale of any series in history i really dont get the hype done episodes now and find it all rather boring maybe i was expecting too much when someone told me it similar to battle royale i fail to see what got people so hyped about this it is slow veeeeryyy predictable characters not relatable at all long winded bathetic yes that is a word scenes borderline annoying characters no skill or smarts needed only luck very poorly written twists that fail to be twists and so on this is a huuuggeee disappointment the peer pressure made me watch this i wish this show came out about years ago as some small part was predictable but was i surprised oh boyi definitely was dont need a second season but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies this was brilliant a number of excellent films have come out of south korea over the past decade or so now this a blinder of a tv series absolutely fantastic was thinking of cancelling netflix but glad i didnt fantastic show hoping there will be a season really entertaining we were very roped in the whole time emotional at times check it out i watched episode on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series and they were absolutely right i was captured right away the series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing beware cause there is more than enough violence in the series and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters at the same time that you despise others keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events you probably wont see them at first but they are cleverly thrown in often the best thing about this series is the acting my mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances there are true emmy or oscar level performances throughout the show one of the best series ive watched in a long time i wanted to like this i love asian film and tv from most of their countries and this entry started interesting enough but even some of the initial elements forbode what my instincts told me would be a lame ending thus maintaining the we dont care what we put out tradition of crappy netflix fare hours to a horrible disappointing payoff it started to go off the rails and become a self righteous preachy mess around episode i wont give away the ending but i warned you though im sure the lemmings who follow anything will applaud it bad acting and foolish composition i just cannot grasp why people rate this over points really if it dosent take more than something like this to get great rating the quality perception has really deteriorated during the pandemic i seriously dont know what the hype is all about is it because people get killed while playing a game is it because of this supposed social message it wants to convey because if it is then there are a lot more movies and series that do the same thing only better to me it came across as over hyped and the episodes were too long started well but mid way through it gets tired and feels sluggish the games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc the ending was horrible and vagueit shows that losers will be losers even after winning just not relevant in todays world nothing more than a korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism democracy ethics etc terrible acting cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time this show has a great script excellent actors but fails to keep the viewers interested because it is really slow i often have the feeling that many scenes are there just to make the show longer adding very little to the plot this show could easily have episodes and that would improve a lot its entertaining value quickly became my favorite show of all time honestly i found it extraordinary one of the very few times ive found a show worthy of all the hype from the cinematography to the concept and everything in between but please watch it with subtitles it makes a huge difference i watched it dubbed the second time amd it takes so much away very entertaining and high in production quality but it suffered from some predictable writing and over the top acting issues it was obvious from the get go who was going to win and last the longest because those were characters that received the most development however some of the plot twists worked including the one at the end most episodes were well paced and a pleasure to watch thanks to lots of brutal action and decent dialogue but the episode when everybody left could have been better ill also say that the red hair ending and not getting on the plane was a bit weird and it was disappointing not hearing anything more about the police officer considering how op he was earlier on several characters were overdone acting and dialogue wise like the woman who struggled to find a team and the main character in places however there was a good mix of characters the acting was generally impressive and the extras did a good job then the cinematography setspropscostumes visual effects editing and soundtrack were all excellent for a tv show this show was terrible dont waste your time believe the hype truly awesome tv boring and predictable let s start saying that eastern culture is completely different from the westernsaid that i don t understand how this show is popular in europe us this is just the proof that people follow what is popular many asian might find this serie amazing but from a western guy point of view i have to say acting was terrible a lot of overreaction for nothing read that dubbing was bad not at all that s how asians talk and behave if you didn t like the dubbing is because you don t like the style as different from your culture everything in the movie was very predictable at least untill episode then i stopped watching extremely forced and pointless emotional scene build up on hypocrisy and very obvious cliches the idea itself was nothing new but good the rest rubbish i could like it if i was asian or maybe years old without splatter scene this show is very overrated and overhyped its a unique concept but it feels very unoriginal with all that said it was very entertaining show that keeps the viewers engaged throughout most of it its very detailed and one of my favorite details is the main characters number with his number in the game being it was a constant reminder of how many other players there were overall its worth a watch but goes over the top in the genre every once in a while i dont honestly understand the plot line or attraction to this show i dont know how anyone could not like this show im looking forward to netflixs future foreign offerings finally finished the writing was fairly obvious and very heavy handed but overall it was entertaining this was one of those shows where once it hooks you youre along for the ride and what a great ride it was three stars for a great first few episodes star for not holding the quality till the end absolute loved this series hope theres a season its good its not as big as the hype its not an original plot but its well written amazing characters the show made you worry about them ok its rather fun but also grossly overrated something is lacking here were used to torture porn for the entertainment of rich people so no surprise here the motivation of the puppet master is ridiculous and doesnt make sense from a psychological point of view so eventually if the show is entertaining and an easy critics of our capitalist system it doesnt really quench the thirst it gives you in the first place i watched it till the end but mainly out of curiosity the concept is interesting but predictable the acting is bad but the dynamics and the filming are good it gives a perspective of a world gone mad with many hopeless indebted poor being the willing participants in a capitalist game despite the heavy theme there is not much depth in the fim makers analysis of exploitation but its rather an excuse for violent entertainment this is one of the best things i have seen in a while it has a simple but interesting story line and has some emotional parts in this is a must see i loved the character development and the sets were great but i felt like the last episode was kind of boring and the ending didnt make much sense i didnt like the series it doesnt make any sense i would rather see a series with or seasons about the life of josé castelo branco too ridiculous series i dont understand how people like this dump absolutely incredible i watched the dubbed version and decided to rewatch the entire series in its original language with english subs if youre not into gore blood or violence its definitely not for you its fine worth your time legit emotional rollercoaster laughed and cried a must see this is an amazing korean drama this drama really show the true colors when one is desperate for money its good but too much character development that wasnt needed should have been ½ hour episodes instead of the hour long ones that most of them were im sorry but super overrated aside from the politics great watch the originality of the sets visuals and characters is entertaining and bingeworthy maybe a little predictable for those of us who have watched so many movies but recommended nevertheless absolutely brilliant great writing every damn actor did a great job the english dub is kind of charming its funny at times but i came to think of those voices as his or hers characters voice this is not some korean version of hunger games i found this infinitely more interesting and entertaining than hunger games it really is a must see its good but not that good to justify all the hype awesome bingwatched honestly i didnt know what to expect from this show things got fricken deep though i almost cried watching ali die he was my favorite character immediately this show has interesting story telling to keep viewers engaged characters to love and characters to hate tear jerking moments character development and deep themes not for the faint of heart but still a great show'"
